Hi! Richhiey here, from Mumbai, India.

I'm a software engineer with 4+ years of experience in AI and Machine learning and a background in Computer Science. Currently I work as a Data Scientist at [PhonicScore][phonicscore], building data and model training pipelines for automatic music transcription. Prior to this I was involved with the data science team at [Skoove][skoove] as a data engineer.

<!-- More recently, I have been exploring the Generative AI space by hacking together an AI application using [LangChain][langchain], [HuggingFace Hub][hf-hub], [Supabase][supabase], [Vercel AI SDK][vercel-ai-sdk] and [Next.JS][nextjs]. -->

<!-- The hosted application can be found here - [https://genui-chatbot-drab.vercel.app/](https://genui-chatbot-drab.vercel.app/)  -->

I have completed a Master's degree in Data and Knowledge Engineering at [Otto-von-Guericke-Universit√§t Magdeburg][ovgu] (Jun 2022), where I was exploring compression of transformer models for piano transcription through [my master's thesis][masters-thesis-pdf] under the [OVGU AILab][ailab] and [Skoove][skoove]. My journey with software began durng [Google Summer of Code 2016][gsoc2016], where I contributed to the open-source Xapian search engine library.

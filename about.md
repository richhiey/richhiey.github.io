I am a software engineer pursuing a Masters degree in Data and Knowledge Engineering (DKE) at [Otto-von-Guericke-Universit√§t, Magdeburg][ovgu], Germany. Currently, I am exploring a master thesis in Data Science and Music Information Retrieval at [Skoove][skoove]. Previously, I was working at the [OVGU AILab][ailab] as a Student Research Assistant on creative research challenges focused at music generation, either [automatically][automatic] or through [human interactions][beatwire]. Working at the lab along with the master in DKE course introduced me to the principles and practices of running machine learning experiments and doing scientific work.

Before moving to Germany, I was working as a Software developer at Mirraw, a Mumbai based fashion e-commerce startup. Here I learnt how to collaborate in a small and focused team of developers building a product. Also got to do full-stack web development in Ruby-on-rails and gained knowledge about e-commerce solutions. During my bachelor studies in computer science, I was introduced to software development through Google Summer of Code 2016, in which I contributed to Xapian, an open source search engine library.

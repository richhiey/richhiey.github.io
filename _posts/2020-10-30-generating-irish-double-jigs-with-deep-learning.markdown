The AI Music Generation Challenge was organized as a part of the [2020 Joint Conference on AI Music Creativity][conference-link]. The goal of this challenge in short was to generate plausible Irish double jigs. At the conference, I also came across ideas from communities around [CSMC][csmc] and [Musical Metacreation][musical-metacreation]. It was indeed wonderful to hear new perspectives and see the work being done by artists and scientists from around the world to create musical systems that help us musically.

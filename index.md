I am a Software Engineer with a formal background in Machine Learning and informal interests in Music and the Cognitive Sciences. Currently, I am pursuing a Masters degree in [Data and Knowledge Engineering]("https://www.inf.ovgu.de/inf/en/Study/Before+you+start+studies/Study+courses/Master+courses/Data+and+Knowledge+Engineering-p-426.html") at [Otto-von-Guericke-Universit√§t, Magdeburg]("https://www.ovgu.de/"), Germany. I have also been working here at the [AI-Lab]("https://ai.ovgu.de/") as a Research Assistant.

I am interested in using AI algorithms to build intelligent systems that can lend themselves as creative tools for musical expression. More specifically, I enjoy applying deep learning techniques to build systems capable of generating music either automatically or through musical interactions of some kind. In 2020, I participated in the [AI Song Contest]() and the [AI Music Generation Challenge]() and learnt quite a bit about the kinds of challenges within the fields of Music Information Retrieval and Automatic Music Generation.

Before moving to Germany, I was working as a Full-Stack developer at Mirraw, a Mumbai based E-commerce startup. I have completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering under the University of Mumbai, India. Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to have gotten an opportunity to work with fantastic people, and I hope to continue the same.

0,"I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery
And I was high enough


Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough


No, I don't wanna know
Where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own


Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?


It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me


I had a dream
We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and The Libertines
Never growing up


I'll take with me
The polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave
Behind the worst of us


Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?


It ain't me, no no
It ain't me, no no
It ain't me, no no
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me
The Bowery, whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful
It ain't me"
1,"It never fades away, it's staying
Your kiss like broken glass on my skin
And all the greatest loves end in violence
It's tearing up my voice, left in silence


Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
'Cause baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget
Reminding me, I got these scars, to forget your love
Keep reminding me, ooh, to forget your love


You left your burn 

You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your burn 

You left your mark 

You left your burn 

You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your burn 

You left your mark 



There's no room in war for feelings
Hurt me to the core, still healing
And I know you're no good for me
So I tried to forget the memories


Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget


You left your burn 

You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your burn 

You left your mark 



Remember I told you
To save it, it's over
And I'll be alright
So hurt me as much as you like
I need you to let go
I got these mementos
And I'll be alright
Yeah


Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget


You left your burn 

You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your burn 

You left your mark, reminding me to forget"
2,"Darling, darling, oh, turn the lights back on now
We're watching, watching as the credits all roll down
And crying, crying, you know we're playing to a full house, house


No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
But in the end, for you and me
Oh, the show, it can't go on


We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh
And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
Oh, it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show
Least we stole the show


Least we stole the show


Darling, darling, you know that we are sold out
And kisses fading, but the band plays on now
So we're crying, crying, so let the velvet roll down, down


No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
Our lines, we read so perfectly
But the show, it can't go on


We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh
And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
Oh it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show 

At least we stole the show
 



At least we stole the show
Stole the show
Stole the show
Stole the show
At least we stole the show
Stole the show
We stole the show
At least we stole the show"
3,"You're saying it's hopeless, that I should hope less
Heaven can help us, well maybe she might
You say it's beyond us, what is beyond us?
Let's see and decide
We've been meteoric, even before this
Burns half as long when it's twice as bright
So if it's beyond us, then it's beyond us
Let's see and decide


And I will still be here, stargazing
I'll still look up, look up
Look up for love
I will still be here, stargazing
I'll still look up, look up
Look up for love


Don't you, give up, for me
Don't fall, don't give up, for love
Don't you, give up, for me
Don't fall, don't give up, for love
Don't you, give up, for me
Don't fall, don't give up, for love
Don't you, give up, for me
Don't fall, don't give up, for love


I'm trying to save us, you don't wanna save us
You blame human nature, and say it's unkind
Let's make up our own minds, we've got our whole lives
Let's see and decide, decide


And I will still be here, stargazing
I'll still look up, look up
Look up for love
Stars don't disappear, they keep blazing
Even when the night is over
And I will still be here, stargazing
I'll still look up, look up
Look up for love
Stars don't disappear, they keep blazing
Even when the night is over
That's how I find the light


Don't you, give up, for me
Don't fall, don't give up, for love
That's how I find the light
Don't you, give up, for me 

Don't fall, don't give up, for love
Don't you, give up, for me
Don't fall, don't give up, for love
Don't you, give up, for me
Don't fall, don't give up, for love
That's how I find the light
Don't you, give up, for me
Don't fall, don't give up, for love
That's how I find the light
Don't you, give up, for me 

Don't fall, don't give up, for love"
4,"We were lovers for the first time
Running all the red lights
The middle finger was our peace sign, yeah
We were sipping on emotions
Smoking and inhaling every moment
It was reckless and we owned it, yeah, yeah


We were high and we were sober
We were on and we were over
We were young and now I'm older
But I'd do it all again


Getting drunk on a train track
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes 

Ten dollars was a fat stack
I'd do it all again 

Bomber jacket and a snapback
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach 

""Re: Stacks"" on the playback
I'd do it all again
 



We were lovers on a wild ride
Speeding for the finish line
Come until the end of our time, yeah
Started off as a wildfire
Burning down the bridges to our empire
Our love was something they could admire, yeah, yeah


We were high and we were sober
We were on and we were over
We were young and now I'm older
But I'd do it all again


Getting drunk on a train track
Way back, when we tried our first cigarettes 

Ten dollars was a fat stack
I'd do it all again 

Bomber jacket and a snapback
Your dad's black Honda was a Maybach 

Re: Stacks on the playback
I'd do it all again
 



Stack stack, stack stack, oh oh...
Speed speed, speed speed oh oh...
Stack stack, stack stack, oh oh...
Stack stack, stack stack, oh oh...

5,"The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things 

The stranger things 

'Cause that's just who we are


We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
How we gonna get out?
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember


We left a life
That's ordinary from the start
We look for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now


Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh-oh
Oh-oh


I see your Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it


We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Show me the sky falling down


Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in an ancient place
Tell me someday we'll get there
Someday
Someday
Oh oh
Oh oh


The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things 

The stranger things 

'Cause that's just who we are
A stranger things 

The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things 

For stranger things 

'Cause that's just who we are
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things 

For stranger things 

'Cause that's just who we are
The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things 

For stranger things 

'Cause that's just who we are


The stranger things
A life, a life of stranger things 

For stranger things 

'Cause that's just who we are"

A hundred times before
But I know a miracle
Is not something to ignore


You take me for a fool

Lost in the millions?

7,"All of my friends are settling down
They're only kids but they're married now
Let's follow the lights
Follow the crowd
Baby we gotta get out
Let's get outta this town


I want an ocean view, somewhere
As long as I'm next to you, I don't care
I don't wanna live my life in circles
I just wanna find an empty road

8,"We don't wanna believe it, that it’s all gone
It's just a matter of minutes before the sun goes down
We're afraid to admit it, but I know you know, know that
We should’ve known better, but kept on trying
And it's time that we see it, the fire's dying out
Can't believe that I say this, we're out of chances now
And I just want you to know that


You and me, it was good, but it wasn't right
And it'll be hard, but I know I will make it out
Step by step, I'll move on and get on with life
So I let go, and I hope you’ll be happy now
You and me, it was good, but it wasn’t right

We've got a wild love raging, raging


Raging, raging
Raging, raging
Raging, raging


Checking into hotel loneliness
It's not what I've been used to, I confess
To wake up three times a night
Talking to a stranger's nothing new
She knows how to smile, but not like you
So I wait for you all night


I know that you hate it
And I hate it just as much as you
But if you can brave it, I can brave it
Brave it all for you


Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Don't you feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging
Lost among a million changing faces
Every day our hearts keep trading places
We've got a wild love raging, raging


Raging, raging


Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Don't you feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging
Rolling on the wind with you forever
Holding onto us for worse or better
We've got a wild love raging, raging


Raging, raging
Raging, raging


Call me anytime that you see the lightning
Never feel alone, you can always find me
We've got a wild love raging, raging"

Not enough, I see you waiting
Your hands up, your body's shaking
That hard look, I know you're faking
I know you lie, I've seen you lying
With four months in front of me
And now we're same old enemies
It's cold blooded, come back to me
Come back to me


I know you couldn't stand to be here on your own
You, you never last without someone to hold
Now you're crawling back, you forget what you are
Know you and your heart are nothing, your heart
You say you're running back and you're caught in a lie
Say you'd rather die when there's someone to blame
Now there's nothing left, you forget what you claim
Know you and your heart are nothing, your heart are nothing

19,"We've been quiet
Said we'd try it for a while
But that was years ago


If you see me, if I see you, mmm
A part of me hopes that we do, no
Say everything we wanted to
After all this time


I cut the tree down that we grew
You know the one we carved our names into?
Still I can't go back to the places we knew
'Cause they ask me if I still think about you
Only all the time


I still think about you, think about you
Only all the time, mmm

In this whole world, what is fair?

Falling behind in what could be, oh

To help you find a way
Through all of this madness
Can I be your light of day?

Know that I am trying
To help us all break free

Turned to one side with a blind eye
There'll be nothing left for no one

It's like you didn't feel it
Not like I do
I followed, I followed the pieces
I tried to receive it
To when it was new


Wanna get out, wanna feel like somebody
But nothing else ever feels like your body
'Cause we held the world, we were turning it
For a moment there, it was permanent
I drive the streets where you told me your secrets
We made mistakes, but we both didn't mean it
And we held the world, we were turning it
For a moment there, it was permanent


I'll bet, I'll bet you're in Soho
Dancing in slow-mo
With someone new, oh
I can't lie, I, I hope you'll never forget it
And that you still wear it
Like all your tattoos


Wanna get out, wanna feel like somebody
But nothing else ever feels like your body
'Cause we held the world, we were turning it
For a moment there, it was permanent
I drive the streets where you told me your secrets
We made mistakes, but we both we didn't mean it

We'll wait for a blue sky
And I turn and hold you

Running wild with you
My thoughts are hazy
This may be way too soon


But I will never let you go
Never let you go, oh no
I will never let you go
Never let you go, no oh


I'm so lost in these summer nights
So lost in your crystal light
And even when this night is day
I won't regret the words I'm saying


Yeah, I will never let you go
Never let you go, oh no
I will never let you go
Never let you go, no oh


Through the longest of time, I will never let you go


If we fall off down the line, I will always keep a hold


Through the longest of time, I will never let you go


If we fall off down the line, I will always keep a hold, oh-no

We'll never be so young
Checking wishes, shock on kisses
Tripping off my tongue


See I'm giving up the fire
They said it was too late for us
But we are coming back to life
A little every time we touch
I wanna run away tonight
I feel like I'm in love with you
Tomorrow we can face the lie
Right now, let's just


Cruise
Cruise
Cruise
Cruise


Open windows, all four fingers
Dancing on the wind
My heart's thumping, goosebumping
All over my skin


See I'm giving up the fight
They said it was too late for us
But we are coming back to life
A little every time we touch
I wanna run away tonight
I feel like I'm in love with you
Tomorrow we can face the lie
Right now, let's just

27,"Sitting at a bar with some friends
Telling them the things that you said
Left me with my heart in no hands
Told me we'd be better just friends
Staring at a television
Something 'bout the world's gonna end


I think about you
You think about me too


If we're losing our minds
I'd get lost with you
If we're all gonna die
I wanna die with you


I wanna die with you
I wanna die with you


I've been seeing tears all morning
Feel like my apartment's flooding
I don't even know where we left it
Maybe I just need to take a shower
Washing off the last ten hours
All I smell is coffee and cigarettes and you


I'm thinking about you
You think about me too


If we're losing our minds
I'd get lost with you
If we're all gonna die
I wanna die with you


I wanna die with you
I wanna die with you

Don't come and find me
So hard to see you cry
Please, somebody blind me


'Cause I can feel it
I'm still lagging onto every word
My heart is beating
And I'm sorry that I left you hurt


We were kids in love
And then we grew up
But won't you hold me close tonight
Like we're kids in love?
Kids in love
Kids in love
Kids in love


We were kids in love
We were kids in love


Engine on, in the drive
Running for hours
Slowly, we twist the knife in
Folding like towers


And I can feel it
And we're running out of hope tonight
I hear you breathing
As we're hanging on to you and I, oh


We were kids in love
And then we grew up
But won't you hold me close tonight
Like we're kids in love?
Kids in love 

Kids in love 

Kids in love

Maybe I could cope if I could hold you
We were kids in love
One last time, one last time
And wherever you go, I'll just hold you forever
Maybe I could cope if I could hold you
We were kids in love
Kids in love 


Kids in love 


Kids in love

29,"Seven months, two weeks and seven days
Since I left, who's counting anyway?
But for me the only thing that’s changed
Is the distance between New York and LA
Seven months, two weeks and seven days
Since I was so easily replaced
It's so strange how I recognize her face
But tell me, does she make you feel the same?
Kills me to know she's sleeping in my place


It’s midnight and I'm wasted
So wasted, I'm wasted
I can't believe I'm calling you up again
I know I might be crazy
So crazy, I'm crazy
I can't believe I'm calling you just to say


I’m not okay
I just called you to say 

I’m not okay 

I just called you to say 

I'm not okay


I’m not okay


Medicate
With whiskey and cheap wine
But it don't stop this train wreck in my mind
My friends all say that all will heal in time
But the truth is it don't give me peace of mind


It's midnight and I’m wasted
So wasted, I'm wasted
I can't believe I'm calling you up again
I know I might be crazy
So crazy, I'm crazy
I can't believe I'm calling you just to say

Love you more than dope
Know I got a temper
But if it came down to it
Up against the ropes
I'll be in your corner


Gonna just come out and say it
I think both of us are crazy
But I love you anyhow
It's just how we get down
One of us lost and the other is found
I found myself a partner
Even though it's getting darker
If you feel like hope is gone
We can make it 'till dawn
Baby, we gotta just keep holding on


Don't let me go, don't let me go
I can't take it
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun
You know that I'm your ride or die
So quit thinking
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun


I hate your taste in music
Hate it when you smoke
But your kiss is fire
And if I said I'd leave you
If I said it goes
Then I'd be a liar


Gonna just come out and say it
I think both of us are crazy
But I love you anyhow
It's just how we get down
One of us lost and the other is found

I ain't the best at times, I'm told

We wanted everything
When we were young


We were kids, try'na make it up
As we go along, as we go along
We were kids, try'na make it up
As we go along, as we go along

We got by even when we fucked it up
Nobody ever told us it was wrong
Nobody ever seemed to care it was gone

And I am trying not to drown
Fell in deeper this time and I'm struggling to get out
And doubt creeps into my soul
And now, I've found there's nothing left to hold


Tonight, I feel like I'm lost in the desert
But you're my oasis, yeah, you're my oasis


I thought I'd died
I had no fight, I had given up
Thought I was done, I was savaged by the sun
I thought I'd died
I had no fight, I had turned to dust
When I came to in your arms I knew I would make it through

33,"You're more than just a notch in my belt
A story to tell
The only thing on my mind
And it's keeping me up at night 

I know you're making magic somewhere
But not by yourself
That might be the reason why
It's keeping me up at night 

I can smell you on the pillow where you used to lay
And it's keeping me up at night
And it's keeping me up


Another night, another strangers door
Hoping when it opens I'll see you 

You 



You're more than just a notch in my belt
A story to tell
The only thing on my mind
It's obvious I'm not doing well
Do you see these eyes, when have you known me to cry?
I'm just sitting here remembering how your lips taste
And it's keeping me up at night
And it's keeping me up


Another night, another strangers door
Hoping when it opens I'll see you 

You 



Wishing I could go back
Wishing I could go back
Wishing I could go back
Wishing I could go back
To that night
To that stranger's door
Knowing when it opened I'd see you

We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out?
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember


We left a life
That's ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now


Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there


Someday
Someday


I see a Technicolor shadow
Underneath your window
Just in case you don't know
I can see it
You cast an unfamiliar day glow
Different than what I know
Shining like a halo
I can feel it


We turned our back on ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Show me the sky falling down


Castles glitter under Spanish skies

In a town that never sleeps
Without you lying next to me
All the phones and faces droning
On and on and on
The longer the distance is
I forget about our differences, oh-oh

There was guiding lights pulling me closer to an end tonight
When I saw you standing there like
Something from a dream calling to me
I knew there was no time to be wasting


I asked if I knew you 'cause I felt a pull from some greater feeling
That took hold of me in that moment
And I know it's childish of me to think such things, to say such things

'Cause I'd walk a million miles just to know your name
I know you said you felt love before, this ain't the same
And I can't let you go 'cause this feels like forever, ooh
Feels like forever tonight


Feels like forever tonight
Feels like forever tonight
Feels like forever tonight
Feels like forever tonight


Feels like forever tonight


Took a taxi out under those city lights
Chasin' dreams on a dime
There was no time to be wastin'
She said, ""Don't you say those words 'cause I
Think I feel the same"", I just
Stood there laughin', she was
Dancin' in the rain
She said, ""Have you ever felt, like you been
Waitin' your whole life, just for
One moment, just for one moment?""
She said, ""Have you ever felt, like you

All I ever needed
You're the kind of high that keeps me wantin' more
Oh, I can't let go, I'm forever yours
You were, you were
To die, to die for


All I ever needed
You're the kind of high that keeps me wantin' more
Oh, I can't let go, I'm forever yours
You are, you are
To die, to die for"

Eyes so bright in this sunset town
Calls you in just to spit you out
Heart black and blue
Another sunset down


Don't have to talk about it now
And if you need me, I'm around


Oh, I don't know what you're going through
You don't have to walk alone, I'll follow you
All the highs and lows, I'll ride them with you
You don't have to walk alone, I'll follow you 



You don't have to walk alone, I'll follow you 



Blurry nights in a motel room
Morning light always comes too soon
You do your time
And I'll be by your side


We got this life to work it out
And if you need me, I'm around


Oh, I don't know what you're going through
You don't have to walk alone, I'll follow you
All the highs and lows, I'll ride them with you
You don't have to walk alone, I'll follow you 



Follow you, follow you, follow you, follow you
Follow you, follow you, follow you, follow you
Follow you, follow you, follow you, follow you
You don't have to walk alone, I'll follow you 



You don't have to walk alone, I'll follow you

58,"You were my closest friend
My strength when days gone mad
But I spent my time in shallow sheets
I should've seen your hand
I didn't see the signs
I was blinded by the lights
And lost where I belong


I thought that we'd grow old
Give kids our bad advice
Now I'm alone
You went and left me with these sleepless nights
You took my warmth and soul, left me with doubt and cold
Is this where I belong?


Gone are the days of young
Better run for cover
There's no one here to savе you from yourself
When you discover it's hard
You don't know how to carry on
Gonе are the days of young
Better run for cover
When everything you love is lying six feet under, I know
You don't know how, but you carry on


These days are longer now
My nights spent wondering why
And I get mad inside
Did you fight back or even try?
You didn't see the signs
Were blinded by the lights
You lost where you came from


We're not so different, no
We grew up wanting more
But I found it easy 'cause I left my morals at the door
You took an honest heart
And watched it fall apart
You lost before you started


Gone are the days of young
Better run for cover
There's no one here to save you from yourself
When you'll discover it's hard
You don't know how to carry on
Gone are the days of young
Better run for cover
When everything you love is lying six feet under, I know
You don't know how, but you carry on 



Gone are the days of young
Better run for cover
There's no one here to save you from yourself
When you'll discover it's hard
You don't know how to carry on"
59,"You're saying it's hopeless, that I should hope less
Heaven can help us, well maybe ""she"" might
You say it's beyond us, what is beyond us?
Let's see and decide
We've been meteoric, even before this
Burns half as long when it's twice as bright
So if it's beyond us, then it's beyond us
Lets see and decide


And I will still be here, stargazing
I'll still look up, look up
Look up for love
I will still be here, stargazing
I'll still look up, look up
Look up for love
Look up, look up
Look up for love


I'm trying to save us, you don't wanna save us
You blame human nature, and say it's unkind
Let's make up our own minds, we've got our whole lives
Let's see and decide, decide


And I will still be here, stargazing
I'll still look up, look up
Look up for love
Stars don't disappear, they keep blazing
Even when the night is over
That's how I find the light
That's how I find the light
Stargazing
And I will still be here, stargazing
I'll still look up, look up
Look up for love
Stars don't disappear, they keep blazing
Even when the night is over
That's how I find the light"

I can see it in your eyes, the way you lie, I'm such a fool


One too many times, I'm the one to take the burden

So if I let down my guard, if I rip out my scars
And I show you my heart, am I beautiful?
If I tell you my secrets, show my dark and my demons
Tell me, what do you see? Am I beautiful?


Am I beautiful?
Am I beautiful?
If I tell you my secrets, show my dark and my demons
Tell me, what do you see? Am I beautiful?
Am I beautiful?


They say the best way that you heal is to move on to someone new
Then why does every single road that I take lead back to you?


One too many times, I'm the one to take the burden
Oh, you know I've tried, but got nothing, I got nothing


So if I let down my guard, if I rip out my scars
And I show you my heart, am I beautiful?
If I tell you my secrets, show my dark and my demons
Tell me, what do you see? Am I beautiful?

62,"I had a dream
We were sipping whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery
And nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines
We stopped seeing eye to eye
You were staying out all night
And I had enough


No, I don't wanna know
Where you been or where you're going
But I know I won't be home
And you'll be on your own


Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?
Who's gonna rock you
When the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's waking up to drive you home
When you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you
Through the dark side of the morning?

We were back to seventeen
Summer nights and The Libertines
Never growing up
I'll take with me
The polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave
Behind the worst of us

Now I got a temper
But if it came down to it
Up against the ropes
I'll be in your corner


Gonna just come out and say it
I think both of us are crazy
But I love you anyhow
It's just how we get down
One of us lost and the other is found
I found myself a partner
Even though it's getting darker
If you feel like hope is gone
We can make it 'till dawn
Baby, we just gotta keep holding on


Don't let me go, don't let me go
I can't take it
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun
You know that I'm your ride or die
So quit thinking
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun




'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun


I hate your taste in music
Hate it when you smoke
But your kiss is fire
And if I said I'd leave you
If I said it goes
Then I'd be a liar


Gonna just come out and say it
I think both of us are crazy
But I love you anyhow
It's just how we get down
One of us lost and the other is found
I found myself a partner
Even though it's getting darker
If you feel like hope is gone
We can make it 'till dawn

'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun


'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun
'Cause I got to be the one that's riding shotgun


You can't let me go
I'm your radio
Keep on turning me up
Oh, you can't let me go
I'm your radio
Keep on turning me up

We'll wait for a blue sky

I'll still look up, look up
Look up for love
Stars don't disappear, they keep blazing
Even when the night is over
And I will still be here, stargazing

Thinking bout' the way you look last night

Crashing like a wave, take away my pain
We don't wanna waste time 'cause we've been
Caught up in this haze
Thinking for a change
Thinking you could save me


Watch the city rise, burn bright in sunburst
Wanna see a sun rise, we'll remember
I'm never feeling low when we're together
I wanna be on this high, high forever
Looking in your eyes my heart is open
You can read my mind, all my emotions
I'm never feeling low when we're together
I wanna be on this high, high forever


Wanna be on this high, high
High, high 

Wanna be on this height, height
Height, height 

Wanna be on this height
Wanna be on this height


'Cause you're secret
You've turned into my weakness
But I've never been stronger now with you
Turn my stormy skies from grey to blue


Crashing like a wave, take away my pain
We don't wanna waste time 'cause we've been
Caught up in this haze
Thinking for a change
Thinking you could save me


Watch the city rise, burn bright in sunburst
Wanna see your sun rise, we'll remember
I'm never feeling low when we're together
I wanna be on this high, high forever

Don’t let your time run out

Your time, don’t let it slip through your hands
Grab that momеnt, cause you can’t get that moment back
Don’t go, go and throw it away
Bеtting on tomorrow, while you lose today
Don’t put it off to long, here and now will be here and gone
So, don’t waste another minute, one more minute of your life

101,"{verse 1}
Silence, wishing that I could hear you through all of this silence
All this devine it cuts like a knife oh how did, how did we lose track of us, ooh
Sidewalks, we danced in the rain and wasted the days when we talked
Like we were kids and somehow we made the time stop, I remember you said
{Chorus}
We won't be young forever but you know we could pretend
Why don't we get lost together on a road that never ends
Leave it all in the past, one day when we're looking back
We might be older but you know we're never growing up

{verse 2}
I found, photos of us we took when we went to vegas
I hated the one that you told me was your favourite
Think about it all the time, ooh
We were holding, onto the youth cos' it felt like we were floating
Looked in my eyes and told me that you were all in
I remember you said
{chorus}
We won't be young forever but you know we could pretend
Why don't we get lost together on a road that never ends
Leave it all in the past, one day when we're looking back
We might be older but you know we're never growing up
We won't be young forever but you know we could pretend
Why don't we get lost together on a road that never ends
Leave it all in the past, one day when we're looking back

Нет, нет, нет

Признаюсь, это для меня непривычно
Из-за этого я и просыпаюсь по три раза за ночь
Поговорил с незнакомкой, но не узнал ничего нового
Она умеет улыбаться, но не так, как ты
Поэтому всю ночь мне приходится ждать тебя


Я знаю, что ты ненавидишь это

124,"You’ve probably heard this one many times - employee monitoring increases productivity. And yes, it does. Maybe not by 100%, and the effects don’t last forever. However, the companies that are using this software were able to see notable results when it comes to their employees’ efficiency and productivity
There are a few reasons why employees monitoring software has such an effect on employees, and we’ll explore them today
Employees’ Perception
More often than not, when people think that someone is watching them, they’re going to be on their best behaviour. The same goes for your employees, even if it’s subconsciously, they’ll want to show their best face in front of you. Therefore, they’ll improve their behaviour at work to show off how productive they can be
Your PC monitoring software will serve as a sort of a motivator, which will make your employees stop taking excessive breaks, procrastinating and working at a slow pace
When your employees know they’re being monitored, the frequency of visiting social media, news sites, and using other unproductive tools will decline over time. And as the unproductive time declines, productive time rises, and your employees’ efficiency improves
Fear of Consequences
Another reason why computer monitoring software increases productivity is the fact that employees fear negative consequences that might come up if they’re misbehaving. If employees think spending too much time on Facebook will get them in trouble, they’ll stop wasting time on Facebook. However, this fear of consequences shouldn’t be nutrutered among employees
Such an environment causes stress levels to increase, and your employees will feel a certain degree of hostility towards the management, which will ultimately cause them to leave your company
Employees have the right to spend some time relaxing and resting, even if it’s not during their break time. Think about the way you work, you’re certainly not 100% focused on the task at any time during the day, so you can’t expect the same from your workers
Are These Effects Forever?
These effects won’t last forever. When you first install the computer monitoring software, you’ll see a noticeable spike in your employees’ efficiency. Everyone will be on their best behavior, procrastination will be down to the minimum, and all tasks will be completed before the due date. However, as the time goes by the productivity will start lowering Now you should think about other ways to increase productivity, while still using the monitoring software to your advantage. The fact that these effects wore off, doesn’t mean there aren’t other ways to influence efficiency. The computer monitoring software isn’t a magic tool that will fix your team’s issues overnight. You should use it to measure and analyze how each of your employees behave
The data this software collects can tell you if someone is struggling with certain tasks or programs, as well as if someone is slacking. Now, it's your and HR’s job to figure out why this employee is misbehaving, and help them overcome the challenge they’ve encountered. Also, you must monitor and analyze the data constantly, in order to enjoy the benefits this software offers
Wrap Up
As you can see, these first effects employee monitoring brings aren’t forever, and they won’t keep up the productivity levels high for much long. The key is in how you use the software. If you don’t have enough time to deal with everyone’s tracking data, think about giving data access to each employee, so they can track and analyze their own productivity levels
It’s also very important to involve them in the creation of their own improvement plans. This way, it will be easier for them to stay engaged, and motivated to improve

Big mistake, didn't say ""I'm sorry""

Yeah we can take our time for sure
Cause something rare is worth the waiting
Can't you see that I come crawling on my knees
To get you, get to you, get to you
Can't you see I'd swim the ocean just to be
Next to you, next to you, next to you
But do you love me like I love you
Don't have to rush if you don't want to
Oh I'll be patient but just know that there's no way
That anybody else could love you like I love you
Like I love you
Love you
Like I love you
Love you
I know you wanted me but she won't surrender your heart
Keeping me out in the dark, keeping me out in the dark
I know you wanted me but she won't surrender your heart
Keeping me out in the dark, keeping me out in the dark
In the dark...
Do you love me like I love you
Don't have to rush if you don't want to
Oh I'll be patient but just know that there's no way
That anybody else could love you like I love you
Nobody else could love you
Like I love you
Nobody else could love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
Like I love you
Like I love you"

Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight




Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect

203,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I


Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when


We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home


And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new


'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you


Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?


Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you


But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you


‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you"
206,"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink


Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved


So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""


I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face


I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived


So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""


Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, ""Hallelujah, you're home"""
207,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how


People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am


So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are


When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how


People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand


That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are


So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"
208,"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""


I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl


You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl


And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some 
Doritos
 and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night


She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind

Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it


I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake


So don't call me baby

And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you


You're a mystery
I've travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? 


Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmm


I could fall, or I could fly

Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it

211,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive


We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still


So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home


Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die


We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still


So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home


Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home


Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go


When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
""Wait for me to come home"""
212,"I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight


Sei la mia donna
La forza delle onde del mare
Cogli i miei sogni e i miei segreti molto di più
Spero che un giorno, l'amore che ci ha accompagnato
Diventi casa, la mia famiglia, diventi noi
E siamo sempre bambini ma
Nulla è impossibile
Stavolta non ti lascerò
Mi baci piano ed io, torno ad esistere
E nel tuo sguardo crescerò


Ballo con te, nell'oscurità
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi
Dentro la nostra musica
Ti ho guardato ridere e sussurrando ho detto:
""Tu stasera, vedi sei perfetta per me""
[Chorus 3: 
Ed Sheeran
 & Andrea Bocelli]
Ballo con te
, 
nell'oscurità
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi
Dentro la nostra musica
Ho creduto sempre in noi
Perché sei un angelo e io ti ho aspettato
Quanto ti ho aspettato
Perché tu stasera

sei perfetta per me"
213,"I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe


And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe



 on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next 


But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat 


Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe"

Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly


Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life

Straight down the line

Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should'a seen the other guy


This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why


In my dark times, I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time


Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still coming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose


This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies can never make you believe
Running in circles, that's why


In my dark times, I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times

In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep

Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time this is all I could be

217,"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see


I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more


Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser


I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow


I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more


Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser


Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser


And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser"

Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party


That's not who we are 

We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are 

We are not beautiful 



L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere 

I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there 

I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care


We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become


Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran, 
Both
, 
Khalid
]
That's not who 
we are
 

We are not beautiful, 
yeah
Yeah, that's not who 
we are
 

We are not beautiful 



We are, we are, we are
We are not beautiful"
219,"Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons


If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh,
 
stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side


And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh,
 prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky


Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me


Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh,
 
hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky


Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me


And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out


Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire 

I see fire 

I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side"
220,"Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
""Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas""
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 
50 Cent
]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
(
Hey, hey, hey
)


I can still remember 
 tryna shop a deal 

From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it 
, became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell 
 if I'd prevail 

And all I did was 
 put nine-inch nails 

In my eyelids now 

I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales 

Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no ""if,"" ""ands,"" or ""buts"" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said


It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy


Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem, 
50 Cent
]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

Hey, hey, hey

221,"Nah nah nah nah nah


I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man"
222,"You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you


We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too


In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you


We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too




Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too"
223,"I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""


She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border


Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters


She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border


From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya


She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border"
224,"Well get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet
 and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it


And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street


In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona


Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente


And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street


In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Oh, Barcelona
So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona


Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
We'll dance around La Sagrada Familia 

Drinking Sangría
Mi niña, te amo mi cariño 

Mamacita, rica
Sí tú, te adoro, señorita 

Nosotros, vivir la vida
Come on, let's be free in Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
Come on and dance with me in Barcelona
Drinking Sangría
I just want to be in Barcelona
Mamacita, rica
Feel that summer breeze in Barcelona
Los otros, viva la vida
Siempre vida Barcelona"
225,"Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me


I sing, ""I write my own tune and I write my own verse,"" hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
Musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man


All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady


You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough


You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me




My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning


Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!


Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you




Woooah
Woooah
Woooah
Yea


Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day


Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image
Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man


I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man
Don't need yu


Cool…"
226,"Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels""


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree
, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment


The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree
, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree
, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth

227,"The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you


Check it, I've gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you've finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide
Ayy, check


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & 
Stormzy
]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Pour out my liquor, there's not a flaw in your figure, I'm so impressed
Come on, be my baby, come on
And baby, you can call me, it's quicker, I don't be talking on Twitter, girl, 
that is  dead
Come on, be my baby, come on
Girl, stop curbing the question, I'll turn your curse to a blessing, that's overnight
Come on, be my baby, come on
Weigh up your options and spend a day with The Problem, I'll do you right


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you"

And she ain't messin' with no other man
And me and her have something different
I really need all you to understand
That nobody's comin' close
And I don't ever wanna run around
I spent my youth jumpin' in and out
But you know I fuckin' love her now
Like nobody ever could


And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh, no
I'm stickin' with my baby, for sure
Together, or solo
It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no
So, if you hear about my lady, just know
That she ain't the one to play with, oh no

That she ain't messin' with no other man
Now, what you not gon' do
Is stand there, 'cross from me, like you got kung-fu
Death stare, cross arm, runnin' your mouth like a faucet
But you don't know that my girl been doin' CrossFit
Pew, kung pow, hit your ass with a cross kick
Pulling hair out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a lil' blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit, ayy
No one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the HBIC
Couple of things that you need to know
If you still wanna be friends with me


Just know if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you

229,"I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you


And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now


I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now


Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take


And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better now"
230,"I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself


I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself


But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself"
231,"Bibia be ye ye


I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee,
 and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day


Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye,
 
bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye


I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day


Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time

232,"You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us


Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need


I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love


You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness


Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need


I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love


Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling

233,"She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know


That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah


She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know


But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah


Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go


Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear

But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth

So I hold you close to help you give it up


So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love

Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again


We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow


The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I


We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow"
238,"Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us


And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home


See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach


I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop


And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home


See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach


And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now? 

For how long-long I love my lover?


For how long-long I love my lover, now, now


For how long-long I love my lover, now, now

239,"I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend


Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now 

See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me


'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me


I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast
 
and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi


'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me


'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa
 
giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus
 
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator


'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you"
240,"It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady


I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe


SING!
LOUDER!
SING!


This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth


I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe


SING!
LOUDER!
SING!


Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?


SING!
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
LOUDER!
SING!
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
LOUDER!
SING!"
241,"Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, 
you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one


Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one


Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one"

Moves that ain't ever been planned 

No goons that were never in gangs 

Where I'm from, chat shit get banged 

Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand 

I don't mix with the glitz and the glam 

All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride

Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I

Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, 
""That's just the way things go""
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs
 

And you can do Glasto 


But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

243,"I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?


Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind


This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in


I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover


Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind


This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in


All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted"
244,"I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not


So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?


That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied


Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another ""like you""
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything’s great, not everything’s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss


So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?


Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied


Because, if I was gonna go somewhere
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down 

And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will


'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied"
245,"Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them


And my father told me ""son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing


Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love


And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when


And my father told me ""son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing


Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love


And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And all my brother and my sisters
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah"
246,"I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now


Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No


I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, ""Everything that happens is from now on""
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now


Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No, I'll take it back now


Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, remembering our background,
 sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now


Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No


My dreams keep me awake at night,
 written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake
But the other 10 percent, it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower
You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow

In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life


I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


You are my one and only
And you can 
wrap your fingers
 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right


You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes


And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right


You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe


'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right


You were just a small bump unborn
Just four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why"
250,"I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder


And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up


And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I 
go across
 and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets


And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up


And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I’ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"
251,"It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?


So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home


I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to


So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home


And oh, I know
And oh, I know
And oh
I can see the stars
From America"
252,"Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true, I kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But 
 it
I won't be changing the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot?
I think not


I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore


Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with


I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore


And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book,
 
I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing 
?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change 

Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest


I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore"
253,"I'm feelin' like a bullet jumpin' out a gun
I'm feelin' like a winner, I feel like the one
You're doing somethin' to me, you're doing somethin' strange
Well, jump back, talk to me, woman
You make me wanna make a baby, baby, uh


Supernatural woman, supernatural freak
Don't know what you're doin', got me feelin' weak
Oh, I wanna call you fever, baby, you can set a fire on me
Hot damn, pop it like a pistol, mama
You got me down on my knees, begging please


I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind


You red leather rocket, you little foxy queen
Everybody's watching, pretty little thing
Baby, tell me, what's your fantasy?
Come closer, let's talk about it
You want white lines in a limousine
Whipped cream, and everything in between, yeah


I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind
I'm comin', baby




I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind"
254,"I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go


""How long you leaving?""
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but


I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own


I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go


""How long you leaving?""
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but


I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own


Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack
Intends to show love
I don’t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days, I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that
Things change, but for now I'll leave town
With a backpack on my shoulder


I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own"
255,"I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like ""Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance,"" hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 
Paulo Londra
]
I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone 

But they ain't got nothing on you (
Ah, ah
)
And you ain't got nothing on you (
Leones Con Flow
)


Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, ah
Desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
A besarno' lo' do', hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
Parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh 

Pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa 

Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar
[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 
Paulo Londra

I was rolling up something with you (
¡Wuh!
)
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (
Prr
)
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you


Look, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the Rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? 'Cause that's suttin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah


I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone 

But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you


She was like ""Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand""
She was like ""Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand""
Want to be your man
""Boy, I never took you for a one night stand""
She was like ""Damn¨
And you ain't got nothing on you"
256,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to


But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
Should I, Should I?


Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love


I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore


On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?


Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love


All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself


I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love"
257,"I said, oi, you, are you gonna bang doe?
No, I want some fucking Nando's
Wanna eat up with chicken and chips
Everyone knows I freestyle like this
When I freestyle on the beat about chicken
You know it's finger lickin'
And now I'm gonna pass it over to Example now
He's gonna freestyle and he's gonna show you how


Chicken, chicken wings
They're my favourite things and I love to sing
I say chicken, chicken wings
If you give me them I will eat them tings


Yo, and we eat chicken for free
Cause he's got a black card you see
He made a song about chicken from Nando's
And are you gonna bang yo?
Yes please I want some chicken right now
Please I want to put it in my stomach yes
It tastes so good I wanna eat the chicken
With the fucking breasts and the wings
And the thighs and the chips and the...


And all them things that are nice


Nando's from me, fat chance I gotta black card
If you come to me and ask for chicken you'll get a fat scar
In your left cheek
 I eat Nando's every week
Sometime on a Tuesday, sometime on a Thursday 

I get free drinks, refillable even when I'm thirsty
On a Thursday I eat chicken in the worst ways


Yeah, I said we are on tour, saw him
I'm like get out the store, yo!
Cause you are a whore
Eat Nando's for free everyday on tour, yo!
And it's a par, I ate Nando's from your car
Can't freestyle cause you'll see me starve
I slap you in the face cause like I'm like Febreeze ya!


Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
I eat chicken off the floor
I eat chicken off the bone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken off the floor
Chicken off the sky
Chicken off the bone
I eat chicken off the bone


I love Nando's more than your mum does
More than your mum does
Nando's 


I love Nando's
My tongue is on fire
I wanna say Elliot 

Nando's I desire 

I want some free Nando's from your black card


You ain't getting in my wallet
Ain't getting in my wallet
I'm on it, I'm on it 

You ain't getting my wallet


Cause I need them pounds every time I go there to eat my food
And you're so fucking rude you don't fucking buy it for me
So I want Nandos for free
And you look like you put your fingers in electricity sockets
To get your hair up like this


You're never touching my card, this is my card
You're never touching my card, this is my card
You come to me, play your guitar
Step to me hard, you ain't getting my card star


I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's 

I want some Nando's right now"
258,"Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word ""rape"" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in


She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly


Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, 
you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is making you age
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back
She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn


She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly


Now an angel will die, covered in white
With losed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time now, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line


Little lady, you're trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police in
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""Who you working for?""
He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
He's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, ""Where you been, bitch? I wanna know""
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's something new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point, your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday


And we're all under the upper hand
And going mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
And fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
And angels to die"
259,"He rode through the streets of the city
Down from his hill on high
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobble
He rode to a woman's sigh
For she was his secret treasure
She was his shame and his bliss
And a chain and a keep are nothing
Compared to a woman's kiss


For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are ..."
260,"Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul


I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love


It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say


Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing

Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby


I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love


It's you and only you that can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
Baby, I can't wait, in love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now

My, darlin', I'll be all you need, you need (
Oh

261,"I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again


Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?


And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
 so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again


Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?


Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh won't you leave me now?

Oh Nina
You should go, Nina


Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina


Oh, won't you leave me now?


And I've been living on the road, Nina


But then again you should know, Nina


Cause that’s you and me both, Nina


Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina


Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina


Oh, won't you leave me now?


And I've been living on the road, Nina


But then again you should know, Nina


Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

Weigh down in my soul

Hunger more profound

But they may as well all be in vain

And let lightning be the veins

Everything is already part of a plan

200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent

I'm not a regular person

East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talking about love and life
Oh how lucky am I, when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way, to spend a moment or two
To be lying awake, and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I got to do
To be making a change, now the moment of truth


Why I’m feeling so nervous?
Things are going so perfect
Now I know that it’s worth it
To spend forever with you


So I count to three, and get down on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right
So I ask you, tonight, will you marry me?
Just say yes
It's one word, one love, one life


A gentle touch of the hand, fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh I was caught unaware
Oh so many times, I gazed in both of her eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of a life
Some will reappear, burning auburn and red
I'll chest the pill, bring us home to bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
What a wonderful way, to fall in deeper in with you


Why was I feeling nervous?
When things were going so perfect
Well, now I know that it’s worth it
To spend forever with you


So I count to three, and get down on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right

So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all


Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all


A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again

270,"I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lines, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
They showed me the locked doors I find another use of key
And you'll see


I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow


I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day

And I'll find comfort in my pain

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner
I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue, and
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngen
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away


I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear

I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish


I wish my family and friends, they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh
And I wish I'd never run through
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, ""Fuck you""
I wish I was home more
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more
People that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for
And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?
Oh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressing 'cause
Every day this cocaine gets the best of us
Usin' my balance on razor blades
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait

I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish


I'm using jumpers for goalposts,
 
cigarettes for throat coat
Mum sayin', ""Don't smoke,"" no, I don't listen,
 I got
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign
Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine
Shit quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me, ""Work hard and you can never be shit""
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Set back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had

And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh


But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next to you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least you're next to me
And if I wake up, you say it's late love, get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me


But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird


And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You make me scream, and then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die


But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
You're my little bird"
274,"Ayy, I waited for you all day


I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' ""There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own""


There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over
[Chorus: H.E.R. & 
Ed Sheeran

(
She say
) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(
She say
) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time


I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, ""Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own""
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't
[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 
H.E.R.

275,"This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, ooh


And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall, now


You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing


And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall, now


And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall, down to earth
Take me back, for


This is start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new"
276,"Born with a heart
That could ache more than beat
The mind of the killer
The soul of the meek
Born aimless and angry
Ran hard from the day
Left love at the crossroad
Into a man that I hate


Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I drop to my knees?
Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?


King of the kings, do you feel any pain?


I fight for the hope
That blood has a face
To give me a kiss
For the faith that I wait
Flock with no shepherd
Is a vulnerable game
I can live without heart, without love
But I do need a name


Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I drop to my knees?
Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?


King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?"
277,"I still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flow's developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women and then I packaged the image
Put in some content and I then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rappping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this


You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
X2
You need me


I said you need 3 man I don't need 2
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up
In my own gear like I'm stepping on a double clutch
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching
Now I've found out being odd ain't even
I qualified for everything, long straight season
It's not a dilemma king, got a straight queening
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in
MC with the mic is MC dinner time
Now I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light
I didn't even have to do a disco rap
I bet I still end up with a Sisqó plaque
This is what happens when your gift is talent
And all you imagined exists, imagine
I never drop shit and I came from the back end
Now I've got the game in my hand, I'mma smash it




You need me, but I dont need you
D-E-V-L-I-N Ed and 32
Lyrically more capable to break 'em all
I won't have to amputate a lower limb to make them fall
Like autumn, check my post mortem
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for this fortune
I don't mean money, I mean luck
But now the clock's aviated
Everybody's time's up
Nothing's what I had and everything's what I gave
Like a sprinter near the finish line fighting for his place
Keep your diamonds and your chains
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe
Cause I get respected
While they get detested
Tell the truth there ain't nobody that done what Devs did
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9
You ain't competition just a fish you're tryna bite a line

"
278,"You’re not her, though I try to see you differently
I tow the line, you see, I’m searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes, and I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her


I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear


When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you


She was mine
I was hers and all that’s in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be


I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear


We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you


Don’t drop me in, it’s not my turn
If you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scarred and left me, like a sunburn
Don’t drop me in, it’s not my turn
And if you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scar and leave me, like a sunburn


We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you"

I do deals, but I never get twanged 

Moves that ain't ever been planned 

Know goons that were never in gangs 

Where I'm from, chat shit get banged 

Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand 

I don't mix with the glitz and the glam 

All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride

Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault 


Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour 


Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? 


But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael 


He said, ""Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown""

Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low 


Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome 


No town does it quite like my home 


So take me back to— 
Birmingham, 0121, stand up!


You better tell them the hooligan's here
My team can't lose when I'm here
Outside, quick twos and a beer
You see me when I choose to appear
Just paid a few bags for my carpet
Blud, take off your shoes when you're here
Yo, I can turn boos into cheers
Tiptronic man cruise through the gears
Rep blues when I'm here
It's Brum
Fam, are you dumb?
Red red wine or you want a redrum
You can be forty, you don't wanna war me
End of story, you're gunna get spun
Man smoke weed til my whole head's numb
Don't talk greaze 'cause I won't take none
VIP in my own section
Wild wild west with the old western, it's Brum!


Old school raving, back to scally
And the AP, packed with gally
Take me back to Manny
Blacked out Roll full of yack and maggy
And a S3 boot full of packs of Cali
Hit the booth, man, slap it, snap it
Bap bap, that's that, track wrapped, I'm happy
Some man are blessed, some are bad and trappy
Gets cold up north, pack your hat and trackie'
Huh, man was made to set pace
Young Aitch, I came for first place
Made a change to get paid
Fam, I stayed in my lane and came with that flame
Day to day we on stage
Make my K, then I skate and catch the next plane
Baking up when I wake
Rake it up, get it saved
It's make it or break
[Verse 5: Jaykae & 
Aitch

It's make it or break
Human man, still make a mistake
Mad now Aitch just made a mixtape
Told Jaykae to make the next eight
We 'bout to set pace'
I can't get about no more it gets bait
And I don't get head no more, I get face
She don't want him no more, she wants Jay
And she don't want me no more, 
she wants Aitch 


Jaykae, make a lot of P 


Go straight there if that's where I've got to be
Wait, stop, pop my collar, I'm a G
5 million minimum, what I wanna see
I ain't in it for the money, put that to bed
Tell mumsy that I'm on a track with Ed
Aim this one at your head
Write bars with a pen on a pad when the battery's dead

No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely


Another night, another club
Another room, another one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
I don't know why, you're not enough


No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
'Cause maybe you could just be the one, ayy


Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark


Another night, another day
Been thinking 'bout it wide awake
I never thought I'd be alone
While everybody blowing up my phone
Don't trust no one, no, so don't want to get close
I get mine, I walk away


No lie, yeah, my mama always told me to be a bad girl
Never let anybody get in the way of what I'm trying to do now
This ain't man's world, thank you next, I'ma go my own way
Sometimes being solo is the way to go
When you need to figure shit out
And if I want you boy, I'ma tell you so
'Cause I'm the one in control, yeah

281,"This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into


London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home 



I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two


The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow


London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home 



I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two


And my lungs hurt, and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along


London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two"

284,"Hit the corner, burnin' rubber like a stunt driver
Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin'
On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left


I met this girl late last year
She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe


And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe



 on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe"

Dame, dame de eso, mamacita
Yo quiero más de ti
Dame de tu cuerpo que me excita
Dejaste mi cama oliendo a ti

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Ella me dice: ""No hablemos de más
Agárrame por la cintura y no me sueltes más
Sólo sígue
me

sígue

I'm in love with the shape of you 


We push and pull like a magnet do 


Although my heart is falling too 


I'm in love with your body 


Last night you were 
n my room
 


And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering 
something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you"
286,"Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me


'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me


I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi


'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man


And all I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennessey shots and... all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise the top?
Just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, A lone star
Urban Angel rising from the ashes, surprising all haters
Guiding, now moving steady when we say


Ayy, ayy, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast of celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out, pass out
Yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast of celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out


'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man


My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning
I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning
I've been burning, burning, burning


Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
'Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
'Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'ma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time


Now my eyes are red
'Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man




'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
At stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day
Plus
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator"
287,"Another day, another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated
Another mind, another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated


Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me


Another tear, another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated


Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me


Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
I miss you and I wish you'd stay


Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me


Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me


Touch down
Like a seven four seven
We'll stay out and we'll live forever now..."
288,"I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You’ll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you’ll be floating away


And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home


When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes


I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss of bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, 
these cuffs are covered in your make-up
I’ll never trust you again
You can just be a friend


And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home


When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes


Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact is I
I’m on my way home
On the way home
I lied, 
I tried to cry but I’m-
I’m drowning in the oceans you made


When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes"
289,"Ooh, ooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh now now


Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room
Now this bar has closed it's doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?
Or maybe we should take a ride through the night
And sing along to every song that's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn
Oh no no, the sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM
So DJ, play it again


Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new love
In New York


Yesterday, gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast
And you don't know where to begin
Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know
So DJ, play it again


Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new life
In New York


And every song that plays
Is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying maybe that's
A waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight
In New York


It's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
And we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything that you want
A new love
In New York"
290,"Could I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures?
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt
On a late night, coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine, 
smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines
, hey


I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to UNI
People see right through me, but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, I'm gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1

You keep me warm

And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself


I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn’t sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape

You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that


My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own


'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong

But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose


I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me


I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose


I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me ""son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea""


And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose


Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

And I know dark clouds, will gather me
And I know my way is rough and steep
And the beautiful fields that lie just beyond me
And I know my needs are rough and steep


And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home now


'Cause I am a poor, wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And there's no sickness, toil, or danger
In that bright land to which I go


And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home now"

How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because


My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time


Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me stranded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it


Show me how you want it to be

My loneliness is killing me, and I

Waking up, midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said


So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke


Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be touch and go


It's not enough, to say I want ya
Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt
I had have just been questioning it


If I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now

Though my soul, oh oh oh

How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be


All of my bones, they scream I'm right
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling my soul would heal


If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the wrong
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, how long
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go"
300,"For fuck's sake, yeah
Yelawolf, Melody Man


Living the life of a student, yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind and they say that I’ve been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight and never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad with a ten in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
'Cause I've hidden my pride, giving the time
To write rhymes but I find truth at a quarter to five
Hey!


It’s kinda like I took a train to the left side of my brain, oh, mayne
Puddles of mud, under my love, you know I’m stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology, psychologically insane
Pardon me while I get down, down, down
Making you get up and say...


If you don’t know
If you don’t know by now, you better tell him ’bout it
What you gonna tell him ’bout? Yeah
Yeah


Ten toes to the dirt, pencil to the paper
God has a favor for your thirst
Drink, drink a pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise Allah
To the wheels, I’m a ridah, steel ring, no Prada
Only thrift clothes and my ada-di-das
I’m a fetus in my room, say na na
Daddy’s home, on the mic, hey papa


Back with a bang yo, straight loop pedal, no band though
But every single one of my fans know
That every damn show I’m taking their ears on a journey
Like I’m flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin’ so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics 'cause they think I’ve been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes, rocking a Kangol
I’m riding 'round with Yelawolf in your daddy’s Lambo


Hello me, how ya been?
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You’re probably sipping sweet tea still, huh?
And your piggy bank is full of change
That what you used to steal from
You been playing fools like a steel drum
Pulling out early, and they still come
Eating from the game when you know the meal’s done
Yelawolf is gettin' back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby, sit still, son, woah
This old rock, the hill's been rolled
Still shocking when I see 'em go
Bananas, when they handle this animalistic flow


If you don’t know
If you don’t know by now, you better tell him ’bout it
What you gonna tell him ’bout? Yeah
Yeah


I’m not the average half-a-wit after this hour gets out of this
60 seconds, I’m goin' any direction and
Chasing this Jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
Is probably the better idea, yeah, you move when the direction in
Fact, it's a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blow on this fucking mic like a wind 'til college start again
Hooligans, hooligans rule again but really who’s a friend?
Jump in this lake of fire, jump right back in the pool again
Knew I'd be new again, a student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers, I’m tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4,
 minus war, you don’t want it
Shady Records, I’m already better,
 fuck it, doggonnit
Dog don’t gotta lead, dog’s already home, Jack
Dogg I’m a beast, I’m a wolf, bring your dogs back (
Woof !
)
A melody-man and a melancholy mellow-yellow can
Shhhh, tell 'em how we gonna sell 'em man
[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & 
Yelawolf
]
Been working hard all week
So if you wonder if we earned it, well it's not a probably
So won’t you bring that back to me
And holler when you hear it like all the screams of a Halloween
I got blisters on my feet
To walk at night with you, is not the shoes to be borrowing
So won’t you bring that back to me
'Cause all the soul of my pen is only what all the sorrow brings
If you don’t know


You don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know 

If you don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know 

If you don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know 

If you don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know 
"
301,"There wasn’t much left
Except for the last twenty sack
And the last twenty of my last cheque
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step
Woke up and took it in with a half breath
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick
I lit my cigarette, feeling half dead
Whisky on my mind, then came the debt
Sheriff in the yard, here comes the rest
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by
My girl cried 'baby this’ll be my last bye'
Baby in her arms, she took a cab home
She told me I was only good for a sad song
A crooked smile I gave, nonchalant about it
Maybe she’ll come back, this time I doubt it
Act like I care, but I really don’t
Wanted to change but somehow I knew I really won’t
See I’m the type of man who can’t stay out the bottle
If the sun is out I’d rather be in the shadow
Sadness is like a wound that I can’t heal
Maybe I love blood, I just let it spill
And I never turned to church for a praying hand
God’s not going to lend another saving hand
If the time came like it has time again
Then I would watch the clock, and be late again
One gun and a harley in the driveway
One way out, dirt road pathway
Put another dead butt in the ash tray
I stand up still drunk, half baked
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring
Paid him no attention, in fact I barely seen him
Until he walked away, and he started singing…


London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don’t stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we’ll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we’ll crash, crash, right down again


I didn’t see it coming, I didn’t see the wall
And I went from running to a slow crawl
I feel like I’m a child, but I’m afraid to cry
Would say I’m okay, but I’m afraid to lie
I speak no evil, but hear no angels
My family is callin’, but all I see is strangers
Take the bible from the hotel drawer
Hell froze over, ice cold, hell’s door, knock-knock,
I’m on the salt road non-stop
The exit I will pass ’cause the sign did rot
In the gust of a dry summer
Dirty water in the tap, I think I found my number in the sand
Right next to an empty can
Old number seven, Jack is back again
And the voice goes round and round
And I would take the bridge but I can’t forget the sound


London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don’t stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we’ll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we’ll crash, crash, right down again


I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down


And we’ll crash, crash right down again
Oh we’ll crash, crash right down again


I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down"

That left us on the floor
And you squeeze me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up, if we go to Brighton I'll
Take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up, and if you feel too frightened I'll
Make things disappear

Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now

I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too
, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you


Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you breathe me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated;
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been jaded, and this love's too overrated;
See what's going on


And darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go

Take me back to Albert Road

And I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress

So let it out
I let it out now

I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note ""I'll be back in 5""
Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey


I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do


But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that

Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her

And pretends she knows the words to a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey

307,"She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5:01 like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed and I'm way too tired
Hoodie still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day


And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high


We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you


When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula 1
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day


And it's cold outside again
And we're still so high


We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you


And it feels like I'm flying
And it feels like


We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York, that is where I will take ya
Paris, Rome, to Rio, passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you"
308,"Faces change
But this place'll stay the same
And I'll know when I'll go
Home


Yeah, and I'm pickin' up another bag
And I pack another knapsack
The airport's like a stop light to me
Sittin' on red, green light go
Can't see my family
My family grew into a globe of friends and fans
Or some may call 'em
And it's on the stage I stand
To jam, rock, sing
No wakin' up to stop the dream
I lived the life, signed a picture
Cause no dam could stop the stream
Or flood gates, I'm in a fucked race
And a pocket fulla culture condoms
They put you on the podium for first place
But on the block, they judge you on 'em
So
Who got the South in a six-pack, and a shotgun just for show?
I put the white boys back in gold teeth
Put the hood in mossy oak
I'm the
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life
Beat me down with criticism
But at least the critic's write
With a broken pen, there they go again
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' gem
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in
I'm goin' home, I'm home again
Bring it back up in the U.K
With a Dixie flag and a sixty sack
Catfish Billy, hell, you say
I'm just bein' blunt, homie
Keep the grass




You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly


Yeah, take one look
Better yea? Take two
But if I take that break, as a move you made
This dude you shape, will come take you back
Back to the roots of bein'
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in
Or a spot to sleep in
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season
Cuz I am not the reason
That the image you're used to seein'
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless
Meaning yes, I'm different
Differently made
And me screamin' the A
Is not the difference in grades
It's the place I stayed
Cuz the schools were underpaid
The teachers taught, but to me they fought
The star that was underway
It was under Wayne, it was in my name
Michael, 
M.W.A
Atha
And in trouble I stayed
Breakin' out of this bubble they made
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand
Committed to the words I say
A blood-line's not a family-tree
It's a needle in my skin for all to see
I ain't never got a spring-break tattoo drunk
But I drink and take the ink




You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly"
309,"I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close


5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed?
It's D-E-V to the Zed
Over tired, 
pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll
Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying
Cause I got too much to stay awake for
To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war
Scissors
, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line
Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by


I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately


I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow, 
I live with the rats now and those
That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy
Believe me I'm snake minded,
 be within this great time, be
On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro
Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die 



Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information
And then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets
At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like, ""Oh wow it's Devs and Ed""
What less did you bloody expect from 'em?""
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock
And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake


I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately"

I feel like I had plastic surgery, cause today I looked in the mirror an' realised I'm faced with neglection
Feeling like I'm in the belly of the beast, trying to get out, I don't even think it knows that it's pregnant
Stuck in the dream of deception, similar to a scene from Inception
Looking at reviews from the last show baffled, thinking ""how come I didn't even get a mention?""
Shocking. I think somebody put too many plugs in my extension
I signed to music for twenty-three years, now I'm wondering why it doesn't want an extension
I'm being ignored, even the crowds just staring, I see the tension
Now I'm on the stage feeling like a mobile phone in the basement, cause I got no reception
Ah, no bars, get it?
Now I'm choking, no bars, get it?
It turned cloudy, no stars, get it?
I hit the ground so hard, headache
Ah, it's mad
I should be proud right now but I'm sad
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad




I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep Me Warm
I'm out of sight
With all these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December




Uh, my mum walks past me. my brother Prays asking why I have left them?
I didn't know I broke up with my girlfriend 'til I saw her with someone else in Beckton


I text her, ""you dissed it"". She don't reply like it's none of my business
My mind goes round in circles, it keeps on rolling, rolling more than Limp Bizkit
Why'd you do me so wicked? Something must've happened, how did I miss this?
Love turns to pain, expressed with rage. I want justice but I got no witness 

Now I'm powerless. Probably why I'm fascinated with Misfits
I guess I'm single, not happy, cause my heart doesn't feel like triplets
Ah, FREE, nobody understands but me
I don't think I got no-one but myself, so when I'm broke I still say ""I got P""
Ah, it's mad. I should be proud right now but I'm sad
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad




I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep Me Warm
I'm out of sight
All these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December




So many thoughts battle me, got me holding my head in agony
Trying to put the pieces together and figure out if this nightmare is really reality
So many turning their back on me


It's slowly coming back to me
All I can see is the word tragedy, but I didn't think there was a fatality
Uh, damn, I think I know why I don't see my dad
I think I know why my mum walks past
And why me and my girlfriend don't chat
See, all this time I thought I was mad
I know why I'm not proud and why I'm sad
I'm out of sight and touch, cause back in March I don't think I survived that crash




I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep me warm
I'm out of sight
With all these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December
Cold December

311,"On the last few days of LA, I got taken into this guy's house and he was sponsored by an alcohol company---quite a few actually---and uh-- got pretty wasted, umm-- all times and I was sitting underneath a tree with my phone just putting in lyrics, ""Bah! This is how I feel. Bah!"" And uh... I came up with this song and it is called ""Wake Me Up""
Because I was really pissed, it is quite silly. Bear that in mind


I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder


And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up


And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
Because we've watched it 12 times
And maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blue ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
Because your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets


And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up


And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try to get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"
312,"You and I
Two of a mind
This love's, one of a kind
You and I
We’re drifting
Over the edge


And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?


You and I
We’re learning to speak
With kisses on cheeks
You and I
We’re lifted
Over the edge

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead 



I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on, come on be my baby
Come on, I can't wait for long
You know I love your body but I hate that you a star
No, I do not really need you 'cause you know I ball
(
I'm in love with your body
)
Yeah, I'm in love with the shape of you
No, it do not matter if you're skinny or you're tall
If you're thicker than a snicker or you're small
Get the picture when I kiss you
Diamonds gleaming, they be shining on my wrist 

And I don't know why they be always acting bitter 

'Cause they know that I'm the one that's gonna get her

All the way 'til my bands fallin' over

I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out

I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we land


It’s been this way since we were young
We’ll fight and then make up

315,"Hmm, let me go
To see my family
Please, Father, let me go
As my mother sleeps


I don't know about James bond
But round here nobody lives twice
When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye
Cause only a judge can give you life
This is my advice
Trust me, I nearly lost my life
3 weeks after I got this ride
Pissed like I had way too much wine
Wished I didn't get one
Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set
Even though I didn't have a set one
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination
Then I was off to the next one
20 minutes later I was on the M1
Tired, but I kept on going
Fell asleep without even knowing
No motion in my face
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going
Woke up, lorry, flash
Panic, break, skid, crash
Skidded more, bang, smash
Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch
I was in so much pain
Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini
When I was still on the first lane
Baffled, didn't even know my name
Fainted, too much shock in my brain
Surrounded by paramedics and feds
Trying to get up but fainted again


See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out
Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared
And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go


To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please, Father, let me go
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps


Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open
I could hear voices and my phone ringing
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning
One of the worst situations I've been in
I could hear all of the angels singing
But when they stopped humming
My brain turned on, started running
Still in pain, but it started numbing
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning
I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming
But I was left with a permanent problem
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in 

Ever so cunning
6 weeks later, jogging and running
I used the first aid kit like a drum set
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes
You can't afford to let one in
Never done tunes for a while
The pipeline was blocked
So I learned and done a bit of plumbing
They say tomorrow never dies
But they forgot to tell you, you can
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam
You can try beg for another
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show
Thinking ""I just wanna see my brother""
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up




To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul"

J'étais à l'affût dès que je l'ai vu dans le fumoir
Elle m'a dit : « Tu me plais, j'ai peur de te blesser, fuis moi »
C'était comme un frisson qui m'sortait d'un puits sombre
Une impulsion puissante de mon intuition
Ton cœur est brisé, laisse-moi réparer tout ça
La souffrance à tes côtés me paraît douce
Elle m'a dit : “ C'est de la parlotte, chéri ”
Oui, mais on est séduits l'un par l'autre, chérie
Allez, montre-moi...
Je ne vais pas m'étendre, non
Allons se détendre, elle m'a
Demandé que je l'étrangle tendrement
Alors on cède aux vices sans trop discuter
Elle le sait d'office grosses cuisses pour m'exciter
J'ai mis en scène les prémisses de cette promiscuité
On s'est rien promis, on s'aime pour mieux s'quitter






Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

319,"Hey, can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know, hmm


I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you

]
And of the pieces of my soul


You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh


I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you ""Nan can I go out?""
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you


And of the pieces of my soul


You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh


It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you


There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me


I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you?"

Nah I'm back in this raptures, double my ad-libs
Got them all banging the anthems having a madness
For me the music's the thorn in my vein
Calling my name, yeah, we're lord of the raves
I swear down I got them all talking my name
Been working all year it's the ultimate gain
Uh, look I don't need you making us angry, we were so peaceful
You don't really wanna see us get so lethal, any foe to approach
Will be ghosted and don't be fooled, yes, people


'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me


Yeah, yeah y'all messed up everybody's hyped
Even a blind man can see the devil in my eyes
Many were the times that he saw me stepping on the mic
Setting it alight, come up with the energy and vibe
Feel like I'm back from a coma, stronger than ever
Songs are forever so I'm living longer than ever
Any genre, whatever, I'll be setting off a bomb
Cause my longevity's just too long for a measure
Well I'm setting off better, I'm taking over faster
Showering down, you better put your umbrella on
Yeah I'm stepping up a level, got my foot on the pedal
I'm coming to be the better vision than 
 when I'm spitting
They had to resist because they need a stage to perform
Case and a cord, you won't see me pace through the door
Thinking I'm gonna be rich so I'm chasing the Forbes
Spreading like a plague, songs getting played when I

Yo, living out our days in 

As if I went crazy in a whip crashing the ride
Double ""P"" when we enter that's passion and pride
They ain't gotta life cause they let that battery die
I'm a shooting star that ain't catching your eye
An assassin with lines and immaculate rhymes
They all say they're the truth but it's actually lies
So we hit them with a punch like a Cassidy line
Yeah I tried to relax but you can feel the anger inside
Raging like I stand on the right, yeah my stamina is high
Yeah I'm living like I stand with the Mayans
So think twice cause our plans are defiant
It's blatant you need me, who's this face on the TV?
Come on, we're taking it easy
Got kids in the school exchanging the CD
Love hearing the bars, impatient to cheer me

321,"Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention as she makes an entrance?
Said I had a tendency to finish off a sentence
Oh well, she’s a local girl
No make-up cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
It's like the fast food, I’ll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she’s all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She’s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man


I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone


Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself


And we’ve got that love in us and we're the drink killers
We’re gonna dance all night to the floor fillers
If we talk outside, say ""Hey what's new?""
I don’t really dance so I’ll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight? Tell me if that’s alright
I don’t wanna be here, I’m not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don’t mind sharing
She said I wanna take off what you’re wearing






She’s like the fast food, I’ll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she’s all I need


Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself

322,"I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Darling, you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect tonight


Darling, you look perfect tonight"
323,"Hi, my name is Jme
There was a time when radio played me
'Cause my music came from my heart
It was real to me, but now it's a par
I'm here struggling, keeping it real
While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think
""Jme just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill""
The reason I started making music is the exact same
Reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all of that for this
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is
I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different?
Look at me, determined, man on a mission
My music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'mma do this


I never had a playlist in my heart
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark?

And I don't have time for a playlist)
How much will you pay me though
If this song's not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Thank God for night clubs and the raves
'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down
But cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth
You won't hear me on the radio
But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof
Why is that? What's going on there?
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers, written by the pile

Never feel it from the bass line, feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub

You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat it


Just close your eyes
And all you need to see
Is your heart and mine
Underneath the sheets
Don't fight your demons

326,"I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
Galway Girl, you're my pretty little Galway Girl


You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
Galway Girl, you're my pretty little Galway Girl


And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night


She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""
""I just want to dance""

327,"I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Maybe there's a god above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You said I took the name in vain
Well, I never really knew that name
But if I did, what really is it to you?
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not some victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's ever been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in


When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me


You better wake up cause I A.M making moves
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training
Too busy tryna keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading
I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding
And I had to fight to get her, I am tekken 

Control of my inception
Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection
See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back
Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them
See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish
Cause the haters know where the family lives
Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger
Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did
They say sleep is the cousin of death
But I ain't hearing that shh... cousin, I'm—
Gang signs I'm in LA reading 

I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next 



When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me


They're watching me, they watch me sleep
Let me go
I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep
See, all the dreams I'm fond of
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I'm Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up
And I missed my chance, worst luck
Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner
Yeah, but I walked from that ish
Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress


When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me

By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted


You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak at my knees
Something inside me’s changed
I was so much younger yesterday
Yeah, yeah
I was so much younger yesterday

332,"The thoughts I have could be clear ones, they can seem vivid
The goals I reach are not near ones, the further the limit
I block her out so when I'm looking though my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum
It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots
What's better than thinking about the ones you love?
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm on the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up
No one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is, I wasn't so I'm coming from a quarter zone


And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you


I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
Cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind
Now I've been thinking about this, you told me say ""Yes Nan""
I'm 31 now, I'm still saying ""Yes Nan""
You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one
I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like
Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like
And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm gone I want my music to play
And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about the scene I made
I say the game's better, it's a must now I've gotta fly
My talents gonna shine real shortly, fam i know it
I work round the clock I don't stop at night

Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you


We woke up in the kitchen saying
""How the hell did this shit happen?""
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love


And we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love


We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, you rubbing on it, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right, gangster wife
Louis rags, he sweat it out, he sweat it out, I'm with that
Boy, I'm drinking, now I'm on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
Big body just graining on that wood-wood-wood-wood-woooood


We woke up in the kitchen saying
""How the hell did this shit happen?""
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love


Now we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love


I don't know much about love but I - know I've been shot by you
I don't know much about Algebra but I know 1+1 is two
Cause we ain't got nothing without love
And baby you got enough for the both of us


Cause we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

Slumdon Bridge
Mr Ed, 
Catfish
Back me up, let's go


I’m out to bark again, ball cracked on the target
Demolish it, don’t jump out your seat, nah, take a squat and then
Think while I jump back on the beat, like I need audiences
To speak too like a leech needs to retrieve blood
Should I creep into these ambient sounds with the speech?
 Obvious
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy, that's
Several pauses, you might need a coffin wit'
Holes in the top, with these tubes to receive oxygen

 You're buried alive like a freak, six-feet
Clawin' and snatchin' and gnawin' like a cat, and a dog and a rat
And a hog in a pen with a frog and all there is to eat is frog and they
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth, and jaws and then
They fight to the death for at least a piece off of him
See that, you back two bars again, he's asleep in a coffin, man
I’m all thee all that’s been, ever was, I'm the start of it
You mention the squad and then you mention the god of pens
Not of men, but of harder than flesh, I’m harder than
Titanium breastplates that are polished, then
Sticking emcees up like a fly-trap, or a bobby-pin
When I rap I’m astonishing
I attack tracks like a train-track strapped to a bomb and send
Shockwave’s that's what I made, got this bastard popping then
I spit on my pop's grave without apologin'
Take shits on shihtzus, pisses on igloos
Throw it up 'til the whole fucking world is sick too
Vomitin' stomach-fluid like you just ate shit-stew
Did I say shit again? Do I give a shit, dude?
Neither does Little Johnny give a shit if he sniffed glue
Or Beethoven care if you like his hair or the stick used
To orchestrate
, 
or does a porpoise hate when you dip through
Swimming in his ocean? No, he just moves
What I’m trying to say is
It’s my motherfucking ocean
And I crossed it
Built the bridge,

337,"Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did


Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did


Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did"
338,"Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It's the only thing that makes us feel alive


We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still


So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home


Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die


Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul


Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home


When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home"
339,"I'm in so deep
Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real
Pain ain't the emotion I want to feel, but I'm thriving off it
So it's only right I like this topic, I be on a hill
Keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about, just me, myself and my shadow
And I'm parro, running out of ammo
And it seems like everyone around me's on the same path so it's narrow
The less then the better
More proof for the last one left
So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise, how they ever gonna guess I'm clever?
How can I be at my best with this pressure?
I've got a lot to lose
So when I watch the news, my minds infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress
I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds
And when they left, it looked like I'd had a rave
And invited more than a hundred guests
I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence
It's easier when you look back shoulda, woulda, coulda
But I bet you can't bring should, woulda could back
Back to 15, 

I said to myself that I'm more than a hoodrat


Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out


You can never drown me out, the water supply's too low
And I'm round about 6-1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without
A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
And I'm an MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking?
Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking? I'm floating
Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin when it's in motion
Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken?
No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open
I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon
If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you
Arm for arm, eye for eye
I just want to live my life
But they don't want to see this guy survive

340,"This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it’s late
And sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can’t close my eyes
Don’t control what I’m into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
My hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Don’t control what I’m into


London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home


I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two


The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
So I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I’m used to
And the shop across the road
Fulills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don’t think I’m gonna make it
Past tomorrow


And London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home


Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two


And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this
To keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I
Need to move along


I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy
 when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won’t erase me
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me


And London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home


Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two"

Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
I’ll say what I don’t mean

You can’t remember my name
We’re lost, it’s such a shame


Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I’ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see


I’m strong yet proud
I’m quiet yet loud
And I’m everything

I’m small yet tall

You want me to be

Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say

Really need to know
If you need me when you call
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call


What I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call"
345,"Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show
Every night in front of a new crowd
That's new now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won`t hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me


Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you 

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you 

You need me


I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer you're just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi


Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, 

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, 

You need me


All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and... all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy...
My head in the sky... Ready to die
Ed Sheeran, Alone Star
Coming out here freestyling with the guitar
Cause I've forgotten the lyrics of this bit right here
So I freestyle off the top of the bit with the...


You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough


My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning


Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cos if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cos like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!
Now my eyes are red


Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you


Okay so this is the breakdown bit where we get a little bit funky. Ugh, and I forget about the whole week, you forget about the whole week, the whole weekend. Just forget about everything! 'Cause it's Sunday and we're all gonna get drunk after this and have a very, very good time and I'm not stressed anymore. We're just letting it unwind. I wanna split the room in the middle here. Who's up for that? Not, not, not literally. You don't have to literally divide. It's all good, all good. Peace and love, peace and love and harmony. What was I gonna say? This side, up there, are you with me? This side, up there, are you with me? Everyone scream as loud as you can! 
 Okay, so we found out that everyone's voices work. This side, I'm not gonna insult you but you are West Ham, okay? You're West Ham, yeah? You're West Ham Football Club. Get in the geezer mode, yeah? This side, you're Millwall, yeah? You two, you two hate each other. You two are gonna beat each other at whatever you do, no matter what. So if I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. If I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. Are you all up for that? Millwall, are you ready? 
 West Ham, are you ready? 
 Okay, West Ham, you sing this...
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
Millwall, you sing this:
My eyes are red!
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red!
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, 





You need me, man, I don't need you
Millwall are winning I think


I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you


I got my friend, very good friend Random Impulse. He's gonna come up and he's gonna spit a few bars on the beat. Everyone give it up for Random Impulse!


Yo!
In this game, I am my own damn man, no restriction, post or boundaries
Spouting heat, hungry and my circle always round to eat
Crossing circles, counting thousands at a thousand feet
Counting sheep and he's sound asleep
Summoned from the deep, now I float, to sink my boat, you'll need a thousand fleets
Walk on any beat and stomp it like a thousand feet
Talk is cheap, so I could treat you to my words for free
Now that I'm out, man, I ain't playing like I hurt my knee
It's common courtesy, I left you for a minute
Now I'm back and packing punches like I'm Popeye popping spinach
Eating every course... lunch, I ain't forgotten dinners
Play guitars as well as bars so you ain't rocking with beginners
Sorry, time's ticking, I can't mess with up-and-comers
National lottery business, only winners have my numbers
Man I'm nothing like you fronters, show you how it is
I can't really do nothing for you 'less you got something to give, Ed!


Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me


I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago

Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing


I love her hips, curves, lips say the words

I kiss her, this love is like a dream


So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in

Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me


He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name—hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same


I love his lips 'cause he says the words

347,"Come ye masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks


You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it’s your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
As the fast bullets fly


Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain


You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young people’s blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud


And you’ve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, you ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins


How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I’m young
You might say I’m unlearned
But there’s one thing I know
Though I’m younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do


Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could?
Well, I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul


And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
And I'll follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I’ll watch as you’re lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I’ll stand over your grave
To make sure that you’re dead


Cool
He's an intense guy, isn't he?"
348,"Come on now, dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you
Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags


You didn't know me


You couldn't show me


My one and only
Has gone away
Far away


You'll never leave me alone
Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again
And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you, I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still got to pack my bags


You didn't know me


You couldn't show me


My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
You didn't know me


You couldn't show me


My one and only
Has gone away
Far away"
349,"Met her smoking a cigarette
In  a toilet cubicle
Red  dress, tattooed chest
She's beautiful
This ain't the time or place to start a future
But  darling I don't care
Broken  hearts can find a love
To make them whole anywhere


Oh  darling, here we go again
We are only man or woman
And we all make mistakes
Don't you know we're only human
It's  what our hardships say
And when I heard those words and knew them
I could feel your pain
Cause I have felt the same, oh


She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?


She told about her mum and dad
And they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchanging names
We're two souls intertwined
We have both got it wrong
From time to time and let that go
With each other, hand in hand
As we mend broken souls


Darling, here we go again
We are only blood and bones
That cover beating hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones
But we know who we are
I could put you back together
When you come apart
We should make a start now


She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in your eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?


And it feels like we felt serenity
And some things are not what they seem
My love, right now it's only you and me


She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in your eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?
Can you feel the love in mine?"

Woah
Yeah


Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights
At stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, Now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height, and I'm going hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter
Yeah, the game's over, but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track, without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on the couch
So, you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow
From day one I've been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa
Giving a dose of what the future holds-
Cos it's another day close, close, close, close brrrrr
I've still got a rucksack for the old clothes
I rap with the cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes
In fact, you don't know
On tracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
Man, flows developing
Skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with the A team
I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women
And then I packaged the image
Put in some content
And then I throw it back as a gimmick
The fact is this
I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses
I think I need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders
I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard part's sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping back to back
Cause I've been practising
I'm back to sing this, yes

Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you


One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you


Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

It's time for the party, let's go
Uh, uh, yeah
[Verse 1: Alexa & 
Ed Sheeran

I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes

Finish my drink, say,
 ""Shall we dance?"" (
Hell, yeah

You know I love ya,

I can deal with the bad nights, yuh-uh
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

ooh, yeah
'Cause I don't care as long 
as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere

354,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I


Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when


We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home


And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"
355,"Ah- la-la-la-la-la
I met this girl, i late last year
She said dont you worry if I disappear
I told her Im not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend
Thinking that the trouble would wait
But then, I jump right in a week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause
Until the moment was right
I went away for months
Until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We´ll be in between the sheets until the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should´ve just said
Shes singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
For a couple weeks i
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I dont want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what its about
But maybe well go together and just figure it out
Id rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane or well be missing it now
Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out
When she was kissing him How?!
I was confused about
She should figure it out while Im sat here singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
*Knock, knock, knock* on my hotel door
I dont even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed thats all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun
And I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize
What you wanted
Its a bit too much, too late if Im honest
All this time God knows Im singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe

Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out


We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become


Beautiful people

L.A., m
mm, drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere 

I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there 

I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care


We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become


Beautiful people
Beautiful people
Ed & 

We are, we are, we are




Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party


Beautiful people"
358,"I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly


Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18

An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar

Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat

Oh wow, I said
Sara, what you do is make my soul unwind


Hey now ‘Cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I’m in a mood
So I thought I’d write a song for you


And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
‘Cos you are great, I thought I’d say that


Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow, I said
Sara, you say that you don’t look good when you do
Even with that soul


Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue

370,"Now it seems I’ve been young, dug my hole in the ground
To me there’s only up, there ain’t no point in looking down
However hard I try, I only get weaker
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold


What you gotta do is never get yourself down
Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground
Keep out of trouble, ain’t no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now


Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it


When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky
Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived
And as the mist clears, homie I arise
From my tomb in disguise
I'm all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move
Now back up


Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it


All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who…what the fuck does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder
It don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?


Keep out of trouble, ain’t no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now


Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it"
371,"I felt the fall on my breast
At the bottom of my stomach
She put my hand on her chest
While she looked into my eyes
You rescued me
And called up these words in threes
And you know I can’t forget it
And 10 months on you liberate truth
See, I was wrong on how I hate you
And it’s the worst thing that I did


When I read through you
You weren’t translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I’d be free from it


See, 
all this truth sparks lies in me
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy
The key is just to ignore
Even if this time has made me unsure
And 12 months on I’m back in my mood
See, I got drunk and said I loved you
And it’s the worst thing that I did

372,"I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song


I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight


You look perfect tonight"

With kisses on cheek

376,"Well I once heard a story about a run-down home
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He’s slowly finding a way back home


He had a nice family with smiles and frowns
They never could solve his way to be down
Cos he’s one dog who don’t want a bone
He’s slowly finding a way back home
He had a nice house with windows and doors
He said to his wife what’s mine is yours
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown
He’s slowly finding a way back home
His children have left but the rooms are still there
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair
But far from the nest the babies have flown
He’s slowly finding a way back home
His wife was an angel sent from above
He never returned her kisses or love
But soon he’d found that she’d overgrown
This man who’s finding a way back home
So the leaves are all dead in this broken man’s June
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon
He stares at the floor, no more to roam
He’s slowly finding a way back home

"
377,"This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Can't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into


London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two


The pavement is my friend
And it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow


London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two


And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along


I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won’t erase me
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me


London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
That was fun!"
378,"Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did
Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid

Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home


I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers

Driver, turn the lights off
Lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one
Gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me
But I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one
Gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to
Except get a 2:1


I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my food for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again


It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be


When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet?


So this is the part where everyone gets a bit involved and uh... I introduce myself. My name is Ed Sheeran and it's a pleasure to be here. Who's up for singing a bit, yeah? The lyrics are ""It's not a homeless life for me / It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be"" That's a little bit of a sing-song right now


It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
Thank you!"
386,"Well my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you


‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left


The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you’re too cold
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies
And show you there’s no surprise in me’


Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left


Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that’s what’s going on




You break me"
387,"White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly, fly
Angels to fly
For angels to die


Covered in white
This time
Angels to die
This time


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to die


Covered in white
This time
Angels to die
This time


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly


Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly"
388,"Your love is the strongest thing I know
I reckon it's been doing weights
Eating raw eggs in its cereal
And running ten miles a day
And your love has a driving ban
From trying to steer intoxicated with another love inside her hands
And your love is a friend of mine
So we'll take it care tonight


If you could only say the words
I'd take it and I'd write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Until the day you found me out
But I know your love
And that's why


I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words


And your love
Has never been my enemy
Used to hold me
And promise it would never leave
Never been better since all the therapy
To read the words between the lines
And take away my melody
And your love
Told me it was turning to a different page
And you know, if I let you go
I'll still keep you safe






You are the one I fall asleep with
But never wake up to
Cause work is something you must do
I trust you like you trust me
It must mean true love
It does exactly what it says on the tin
Let me begin
You are the one I watch the movies with
For recognizing my love for Kiera Knightley for what it truly is
Just an excuse so I don't have to watch Love Actually again
But you're actually the same
It's just to spite me
And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it
Until the dishes finished
Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it
I tried to make tea once for you in bed
But all I did was spill it
So you made it for me instead
Let me in bed
If you get in ahead of me
It's better to do
Yeah, love is ahead of the truth
But in love
We are better in two
I'll be the newcomer
Stuck in heaven with the devil in you

"
389,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
Baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Now, I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it is evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"
390,"Hey, look, it's funny how the city where the Queen sleeps still ain't got clean streets
But there ain't a day when she ain't got clean sheets
And homeless people roll with needles
And you've gotta pay tax when you own a vehicle
Tube fare doubles up every two years
And the buses upstairs is a no-go area
The man are like ""pass me your mobile, hear me now""
And chew the crunch on the credit
You can't get a roof over your head, you're stuck in the debit
But every single month they come for the debit
Direct action, if you don't play they
Dive in, snatch things and they don't say
Now the crib's vacant, victim of inflation
The black letters turn red cause they've been patient
And that six years' rent has just been wasted, wasted, wasted


London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps then that makes two


And my lungs hurt and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts but I need to move along


Hey, look, I'm from a city full of jammed up traffic, night buses
All-night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night lovers
That knew when to pay rent and stay in their apartment
Talented buskers playing that guitar riff
The church pastor's still praying for answers
Way too much congestion, they're charging
Way too much for petrol, I'm laughing
But there ain't no funny side
It's like winter all year, there ain't no summer time
Stone Island jacket, keep warm
And all phone lines are tapped, you've been warned
And also mind the gap and keep calm
Cause one wrong move on the train, big beard
And it's gunshots, two in your brain, it's weird
So as much as I'm in love with this city
Just maybe I've had enough of the city

"
391,"My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too


But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself


Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you


I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet


But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself


'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you


With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum


Baby, the best part of me is you
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
Baby, I'm so in love with you
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you"

Been this way since 18

Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us


Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly


Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

Straight down the line

393,"I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryin' act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I'll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
And take it back now
Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinth can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint of McDaid discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
Mmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
Very superstitious, writings on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past
Believing things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way

Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe

Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe

It's not warm when she's away
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
I wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long

Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way
Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way"
394,"Well I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
I’m a bad influence, that’ll do
‘Cos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth, change my clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door


It’s just that they don’t care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don’t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don’t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl’s trouble


Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
‘Cos you’re a bad influence, that’ll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth, change your clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door




This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever, either
Dance as you’re a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you don’t see
Fell the weight, gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is 2D
The only thing that’s free in life is love
And that don’t come cheap

395,"I think I took too much
I'm addicted to your touch
But I'm crying
In shame again


And now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home


Oh well, we've come this far
You're my Venus
And I'm your Mars
And we've passed the moon and stars
And I'm gone


But now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm almost gone
When you get home


So please come home"
396,"Just give me a pen and I’ll write my worries
Now and again I’ll try and not see that you don’t care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life’s bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you don’t care


And hey, I don’t speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile


They’ve written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don’t care
What ever happened to the youth and culture?
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you don’t care

397,"Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night
Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat
Still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night
Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time, ‘cos I won’t mind
I doubt if I even know that I’m awake
And still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more

Shake the thing your mother gave ya!
Tear your lungs out, scream your heart
Be on your worst behaviour
I’d wager that you’re gonna take it
Make you fight nature, born and raised in
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night
Turn off the dark, put on the light
And he said ‘You and your big cheeks have got me’
Along with ‘Disarm’ and ‘Flooded Quarry’
Turn off the base with the beat-box detox
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black
You make the room’s hands laugh as they clap
You make my mouth water with support acts
They could even match you in talent - ignore that!
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain’t wrong
He’s got me singing to ‘Amerikan Folk Song’
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry
You gotta know your enemy
Gotta check your distance
Don’t talk, only whisper
Slap the base so hard you get blisters
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom
JP beat-box, feet as flip-flops
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand
This ain’t no fake, it’s music in your hand
As you run into the centre of the crowd
Silence falls like water
You just wanna shout ‘Wow!’
How did they even have the guts to do it ?
If your name’s Nizlopi, then there ain’t much to it
‘Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around now"
399,"It’s been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left for  me
All that’s left is shattered hearts
It’s plain enough for us to see that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me


We’re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It’s no fuss
I’m not in love


Twisted tunes, a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me




I lost it in your kiss, your lips
Sweetness, in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healer’s touch
It’s true
I’m glad I’m not you"

Can you feel it as you breathe the night air, yeah
I can't remember what you said to me
But I know it was hard, hard, hard for you to speak
Time drift as you speed into love
Heart race as you heat up my blood, yeaaah
Let's just continue what we used to do
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth
And it's late, it's late
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Drift off into space without care
Can you see it as you sit back in prayer, yeah
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth
Sleep tight and I will not wake you up
Kiss me and I want to be in love, heeey
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room

401,"Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there
I walked to Spanish Point
I knew I'd find you there
I stood on the white strand
You were everywhere
Vivid memories fade
But the mood still remains
I wish I could go back
And be with you again
In Milltown there's a pub
It’s there that I sat down
I see you everywhere
Your face is all around
The search for times past
Contains such sweet pain
I'll banish lonesome thoughts
But they’ll return again
I walk along the shore
The rain in my face
My mind is numb with grief
Of you there is no trace
I'll think of this again
In far off lands I roam
Walking with you
By this cold Atlantic fog
Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there"
402,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up, lip sticks to me
So now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me
Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
Who see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
And you don't hold me anymore
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love"

405,"If you wanna put this on me, that’s fine
I never blamed you for anything at all, in my life
Things we try to do won’t work
So can you help me out?
Things we try to do won’t work
So can you help me out?


And say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it’s true
Cause I have fallen for you
Say if you love somebody new


See I wanna take her to the Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly Show
I could have taken anyone there
But I like the way she brushed her hair back
I never trust, begin to realize
How fast I would turn an eye
I was blind to all, yeah I saw all




Seeing this fake heart break
And stomach ache has got me
Acting like a pregnancy


I never fell for you, you tripped me
Cause even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind it's true, in my mind now
I never fell for you, you tripped me
Even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind now, my mind

406,"It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man's land
For the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Sing!
Louder!
Sing!
This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I drunk all of it down
Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Sing!
Louder!
Sing!
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so I hoped you'd take my hand darling
Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Sing!"

A stórín, beidh mé ag fanacht leat féin go seachtó naoi
A leana, is tú an duine dom fiú ag fiche trí
Tá mé ag rá leat go dtiteann daoine i ngrá gan aon chúis ná haon bhrí
B’fhéidir gan ach buille ar lámh

Nuair atá mé níos sine is ag briseadh go mall
Dearmad déanta ar m'ainm arís
Gan mo lámha in ann don mhéid céanna

At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Café clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight


I drill you deep into my chest
That’s where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
Cause I don't want to be alone


Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another song


Café clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But we're only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes


With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue
Cause I don't want to be alone


Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs

There's no way that you would let me hold ya

feel the rhythm of the track
and telling the DJ pull it back...
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say


Softly do you feel that you could love me
and want me
more than anybody else
but then again


It could just be the baseline
That made me close my eyes
opened up my mind
Could you come back with me tonight
It's not the first time
that we've been on our own
So I'll hold you close
And never let you go


you can keep me on the dance floor
but I don't wanna waste your time
Feel the rhythm of your hips more
It makes me wanna taste your wine
Its getting hard to keep in time
When I'm looking in your eyes
Everyone but you just fades away

With a whisper in my ear I hear you say


Softly do you feel that you could love me
and want me
more than anybody else

It could just be the bassline

opened up my mind
Could you come back with me tonight
It's not the first time

But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya and I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again


We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow


The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losin' track of time
I'm holdin' nothin' against it, except you and I


We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow"
414,"I’m getting very edgy
Cos you’re trying to take this from me
And it’s something that I wanted so bad
Cos you’re the definition
Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
Cos you’re a jealous girl
And all I can say is
It’s your fault but partially mine
For losing hope
For not treating you right
But that will disappear in time


All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what’s wrong
Whenever I say why?


Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I’m losing sleep
I live only for the week


I’ve grown to ignore you
Cos when I seem to bore you
You pretend that you’re not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle
Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do
But I don’t care as long as you’re mine
It’s happening every time






And I’m falling harder now it seems
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams
And I can’t sleep although I think I can
It’s insomnia I think I have
But who cares when I’m not your man?

So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox

Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Leave and get in a taxi, kiss in the backseat

On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me
Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore
On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
We'll applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself
I'm here again

It’s getting harder for me to breathe
Just want to know if it will be
Just want to know if it is me


And you know I’ve learned from my mistakes
And how much have I got to lose?
You find my heart is hard to break
Can’t keep playing the fool


Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what’s there beyond the pale


I feel like I’ve gone to the end of the world
What do I have to do?






What can I do
Just to let you know
That you’re in my mind?
To try and justify
The way you liberate me

"" ""Over the castle on the hill""


When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back


I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sun—


Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back


I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sun—


Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


One friend left to sell clothes
And one works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home


And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
When we watched the sun—


Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill


Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

Waiting for you to come
You were sitting counting
The days that I had gone
The note I wrote
I wrapped up in a cigarette
Burned away the memories
I tried to forget
But not yet


Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
I love you


How can I tell you?
I don't know what to say
This chance that I won't miss
But I miss you anyway
I feel your pain
It's turning me insane
Thrown away
I had to take the last train home
But then you came


Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
Wishing my life away
These three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
You know it's true
I love you
I love you
I love you"
424,"Strings on my guitar are rusty
Even my best friends don't trust me
Everybody thinks I must be crazy


Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean


Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean




Everything's in a haze
Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze
Everything's blurry
Oh, what's happened to me?


Say, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean


Now, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean

"
425,"Now I'm in town, break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verse? Hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tune sell?
Call yourself a singer-writer
You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
""A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi""
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can read the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow
From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide 'til we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the Myspace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you"
426,"I'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low...
Hit my plug, that's my cholo
Cause he got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco
Hit you with that treinta ocho
Niggas thinkin' that I'm solo
50 deep, they're like, ""oh, no""
Heard the feds takin' photos
I know nothin', fuck the popo
I'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low...
36, that's a kilo
Need a brick, miss my free throw
I'm in love, just like Ne-Yo
Bustin' shots, now he Neo
Free my homies, fuck the C.O
Fuck the judge, fuck my P.O
All this coke, like I'm Nino
Water whip, I'm like Nemo
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the glass, nigga
I'm blowin' money fast, nigga
I'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low..."
427,"It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh Oh Oh Oooooooh 2x
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe
Oh Oh Oh Oooooooh 2x
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
Louder!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
This love is a blaze I saw flames from the side of the
Stage
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know but
Something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I roll with the chain
Singing we found love in a local rave
No I don't really know what I'm supposed to say but I can
Just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said it's nice to meet ya then she
Handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know it she's a keeper
Just from this once small act of kindness I'm in
Deep if anybody finds out I am meant to drive home but i
Took all of it now I'm not sobering up
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now she's
Kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe

Louder!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance...
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from above
Can you feel it?
Found you hot in here so I hope you'll take my hand darling
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it? Oooohooohooo wappaaa
Can you feel it? Oooohhoooo no no no
SING!
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x

If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rush undo you from your head to toe
Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x

428,"So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skys from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here"
429,"It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight
Hold on


So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart


It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say
That that's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today
Hold on


So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold on"
430,.
431,"Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do


Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new


'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah


Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?


Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you


But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah


‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you"
432,"Saturday, me and my girlfriend are at a party in the West End
And I don't really know nobody here either
Maybe we should've stayed home
And turned down the lights so low
Open up a 
 Bordeaux, mmm
And put on a jam so slow, so slow


She said, ""All the girls here are beautiful""
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Why are we even here?
'Cause all the boys got their eyes on you
For the same reason that my eyes are too
And that's when she made her move
And whispered in my ear and said


Hey, let's leave this party 

Back to my apartment 

There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home


I'm still here with my best friend and I'm not
Disappointed that the party
We just can't fit in with the West End crowd
Can't even hear their conversations, so
Baby, let's hit the road and open up a 
 Margot, mmm
And put on a jam so slow, so slow


She said, ""All the girls here are beautiful""
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Why are we even here?
'Cause all the boys got their eyes on you
For the same reason that my eyes are too
And that's when she made her move
And whispered in my ear and said


Hey, let's leave this party 

Back to my apartment 

There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home


Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, no love 

Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, mmm


Turned down the lights so low
And put on a jam so slow, so slow
'Cause all the people are beautiful
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Whisper in my ear, hey


Hey, let's leave this party 

Back to my apartment 

There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home


Come on and get it started, yeah
Come on and get it started, no love 

Come on and get it 



There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home"
433,"I want to be real
Not some conscience to myself
The way you worship, never ending
Some idol who’s pretending to be true
How you put upon yourself
A man who never seems
To answer to you words
So go and make me over


I’m a fly upon your neck
You can’t control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need


Don’t want your advice
Cos I’ve made up my own mind
The way you bore me with the stories
Of far and distant times
I’ve heard it before
So don’t try that on me
The way you worship, never-ending
Some idol who’s pretending to be true
It could be you
Brainwashed by the lies
It’s no surprise
That you’d wanna waste your time

"
434,"Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna give it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...
I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...
Today was gonna be the day but they'll never bring it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...
I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
You're could have be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...

You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall..."
435,"Mr. Ruskin come and paint my picture
We’re losing sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now who’s your best friend?
Can you introduce me?
See I can’t seem to even let you breathe


When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind’s eye
Please let me forget that I’m standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me


Come and show me if you can
See I know you’re me
But I can’t seem to understand
If you know me, place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
It’s psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quick

"
436,"I write this song in memory of
The wayward smile
The boy we won’t forget
The soul you took away from us
The river flows
The tears that we wept


Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that you’re gone


The cheeky smile
Of jokes and laughs
The memories of times
We crossed the line
The stepping stones
Across my mind
Washed away
We all now feel so blind




Goodbye"
437,"You know I got to get away
To find some peace and sanity
I’ve been playing hide-and-seek too long
Shaking, making, everybody waking
Setting the hi-fi bleed
Keeping me back
While you’re spinning my track
That’ll knock you off your feet
Monkey see what monkey do
But I’m a monkey telling you
I just think that we should take a break
Tickity-tock the clock
With the hip-hop
And Alonestar backing me up
We won’t stop
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind
Now let the track rewind


And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on
[Verse 2:
This is Alonestar coming at you
With a new style
Kicking dust
Ready to bust
It's Urban Angel
Artistic, flipping the script
Who'd you really want to get it with?
Ed and Alonestar
We're like live wires sparking
Ready to blow
We've already sown our seeds
We're just waiting to grow, blow
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body
Metaphorical speech when we come and see
You ducking for cover
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock
With Urban Angel and Alonestar
And Ed, keep it locked
Let the beat pump
Drop the bass but don't stop
We're kicking the sound
Let the bass bins pound
We're gonna roll
Can you feel me now with my body?
Get down to the sound
It's Ed Sheeran in the place
And Alonestar rising up
We gotta rise up
I said rise up

438,"Ooooh darlin' 



Its 4AM beneath the stars under the night,
and you're here, and you're here.
With candles lit the room is dark the moon is light,
we can lay here, we can love here...


Forever,
is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.
Ooooh darlin' 



I bought some food, a change of clothes, a little wine,
and a blanket,
and we used them all...
I dreamt the day away on a planet full of life,
and just stayed there,
i fell in love there.


Perfect comes near,
perfect just for one,
and forever, is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.
Ooooh darlin' 

We're lying down her cheek is resting on my shoulder,
play with her hair, i adore her.
This is the single sweetest love I've ever known yeah,
we can stay here, run away dear.


Love knows no fear,
Father doubted some,
forever, is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.

439,"On Saturday I know that you're coming up to see me
When I go away things will change
And you'll never know it was easy
It won't help pretending that we'll stay close
I can't help thinking that
I try to pretend that it's your loss
And I never know, oh I'll never know if it will work
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
And I left her today
And I left her today
Come Sunday I'll see that one day you'll rescue me
And when I leave again I'll feel strange
And I'll never know, oh I'll never know if you're in love again
I can't stop being a fool for you
I won't help thinking that
Still I am falling for her and she did too
Oh I'll never know, oh I'll never know if I'm in love
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her today
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her today"
440,"In shadow there lies hope
Cut tension with a knife
I find it hard to cope
Stop playing with my life
You analyse my fears
Analyse my dreams
Choke on burning tears
Through my silent screams


Things aren’t what they seem


Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I’ll let you all see that I’m doing better


Watch me fall
As I stumble at your feet
Always losing in this game
Your lies cut me deep
And you don’t even know my name
With your consistency
To always make me crawl
And my durability
Not affected at all






Feel the pain
On my brain
Feel the strain
As I start to decay
Feel the strain
Every passing day
Feel the pain
As I start to decay

But I just can’t spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field
So you can tell them
That I’m a different man with a different tune
I didn’t find love until last June
But I lost it, just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
‘Cos I need something, anything to replace you
Or something close"

You say it’s gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile


You’re wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don’t reach
Your smile
You’re holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You’re eating your fears
In a cigarette
You’ve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea


I’ve taken the blow
It’s all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no ‘see you later’

444,"Now, Wembley, I've not played this song in a...
Around two years, maybe, maybe longer
But I feel like playing it today
Let's see how it goes


You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life


And I'll hold you tightly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright


Oh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
Eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes


I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright


You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe


'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright


You were just a small bump unborn
Four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why"
445,"I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the seen, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and iris's they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they won't be closing soon
Cos i know that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say what ever I feel to vent a rhyme
So i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cos we all recognise, real is what my father says
And i'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But i'll just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close
DEVLIN
5 o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear i said, that i'll sleep when im dead
Whos on the beat upon the feature with Ed its D-E-V to the Z
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage i've acquired
And over the time within this maze i'll think you'll find you'll never find that peace of mind you seek to find until your dying
Cuz i got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
Its time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be
The times i'm living in lately
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me wrong
But they won't slither in too easy, believe me im snake minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that im in
Its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows
Some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with si-li-cone
Im still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cos I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die!
Never die
DEVLIN
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months cos i haven't slept in them, true!
Im coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so im correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'oh wow its its Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect from 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be. x4
The times i'm living in lately"
446,"I keep my hopes and dreams inside you amongst these other things
My mother seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering
Never been known as my government name
My foster home is where I've been placed away from the pain
And now you sit before me, with a folder holding my story
You're my saviour with nothing on me but hope and glory
And surely, you'll never ignore me
'cos when the court came the court date was made to disappear for me
You think you understand me, but never what I went through
But you were never meant to, I won't hold it against you
I take a ball point pen to play dot to dot
With the cigarette burns etched in my forearms
Forget me not, never let me stop, you'll just sit and watch
It's your job to be patient so you'll let me off
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life in a day through a child's eyes


And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleep's the only thing I want to take me away, away


Okay session's over time to get back to the classroom
I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard too
You told me I should try my best but guess what, I still find this trigonometry a head fuck
Constantly told I won't pass my GCSEs
I'll end up in Mac D's serving burgers and cheese
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em
Lately classmates think I'm crazy
Turn up daily resembling Bill Bailey
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it
Without new clothes or shower it's hard to do so
After school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes
But they'll get taken off me when I get back to the group home
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life in a day through a child's eyes

"
447,"You're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I'm searching for what used to be mine
I saw your eyes
And then I saw her staring back at me
And I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you
She was mine
I was hers
And all that's in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be
If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear,oh
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you
Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
If you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn
Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scarred and left me
Like a sunburn
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you"
448,"I went out late last night
And cold air met me
Lost a grip on my shoes
Walked home in bare feet
And I'll stay awake
Till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away, out
Tonight, this day won't end
The fire keep burning now
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight
I'm here again, the fire keeps burning now
I'm never gonna leave here
Let the dark cover me
And hold me tight
Hear the words in my sleep
Close your eyes for a second life within
And I'll stay awake till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away out, tonight
This day won't end, the fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight I'm here again
The fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here
Outside, in the winter, in the cold, I have not been asked where to go, and so, oh
I am here alone, waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
And day, to end, the fire is burning now
I ain't ever gonna leave here now, and I'm here again
Oh, oh I ain't ever gonna leave here
Tonight, I'm out to meet ya
Tonight, I will feel no cold
Tonight, I'll ignore that my feet hurt
And I'll be no more, without you"
449,"Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do


Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new


'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah


Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?


Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you


But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah


‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you"
450,"Made of clay, shoot me down
I'll ricochet to the ground
Words of paint, draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know it's over before it's begun
I lost my way, so help me out
And lend your hand 'til I am found
My voice is mute, not to be heard
So it's up to you for you to bring those words


I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time


This grief you give, it takes its toll
It dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree, whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned stones, oh


I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time"
451,"I really need you
I really need your love right now
I'm fading fast
Not gonna last
I'm really stupid
I'm burning up, I'm going down
I'm in it bad

Could you love me more, just a little, just a little
Overcomplicate when it's simple, when it's simple, when it's simple
Would you love me more, just a little


So tell me now
When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
Oh hold me now
When every ship is going down
I don't fear nothing when I hear you say


It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay


I'm really sorry
Sorry I dragged you into this
I overthink, that's all it is
The way you love me
The way you love me 'til the end
The way you love me
Oh yeah, it makes me king again


When I found myself in the middle, in the middle, in the middle

You can take it to the store
So you won’t forget the groceries anymore
There’s a rifle in the cabinet that I used to fight a war
But to this day, I don’t know what I was fighting for
I’m fighting for


Will you show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet
After 30 years of service and the wounds of it are me
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need


There’s a blanket on the sofa that I used to keep you warm
When I find you fast asleep at half past four
There’s a record we keep turning that reminds us of our youth
But there’s still nothing as beautiful as you


Will you show me love as we get older
And I’m falling at your feet
After 30 years of service and the wounds of it are me
Show me love as we grow colder
Let our love provide the heat
That our older bones are missing
But our hearts will never need


As we grow colder
Love provide the heat
Older bones are missing
Hearts will never meet
Because your hand belongs in my hand
Belongs in your hand, belongs with, with me

There’s a record we keep turning that I used to turn you on)

And I know you don't owe me your love
And I know that you don't owe me nothing at all
Ain't no way I'm giving up on you


Don't leave me here in the dark when it's hard to see
Show me your heart, shed a light on me
If you love me, say so, If you love me, say so
You know I can't live without you, I'm on my knees
Where are you now? Shed a light on me

It’s burning through the evening rain
Sets sail out on an ocean wave

Our love is a heatwave
It’s burning through the evening rain
Sets sail out on an ocean wave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave
Heatwave heatwave heatwave
‘Cause our love is like a heatwave"

It's taking its toll, there's no letting go

Shed a light

Shed a light




Why when I call, you never answer?
I'll try to talk, you keep on dancing
I can feel you on my skin, but am I only dancing with the wind?


And I know you don't owe me your love
And I know that you don't owe me nothing at all
Ain't no way I'm giving up on you

Voices filling up your mind
You're like a ghost of you
You've been drowning in the rain
Slowly saving up the pain
So deep inside of you


See the colors of the sky
Slowly turn from black and white
A rising hope, bright as gold
Now there's nothing left to lose
So we're breaking all the rules
And they don't know what we know


'Cause I can hear
The thunder from afar
A lightning in the dark
I can feel a fire come alive
So calm before the storm
So dark before the dawn
Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes 

In your eyes 

Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes 

In your eyes 

Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes


Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes 

Oh, I can see the fire in your eyes


Now you'll never be the same
Once you felt that burning flame
You're chasing stars alive
What was broken's left behind
Watch it crumble in the light
Nothing can stop you now


See the colors of the sky
Slowly turn from black and white 

A rising hope, bright as gold 

Now there's nothing left to lose
So we're breaking all the rules 

And they don't know what we know, whoa

I can feel a fire come alive
So calm before the storm
So dark before the dawn

Something 'bout your fingertips can calm me down
When you're around the lines


I, I, I need you like oxygen
Tie you to me, breathe you in
Prove it to me once again

My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Aw, who would ever want to be king?

When I should, but I can’t let you go


But when I’m cold, cold
Yeah, when I’m cold, cold
There’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There’s a feelin' within me, everglow


Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night, we’d be friends 'til we die
But the changin' of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the fallin' of snow
And now I’m gonna miss you, I know


But when I’m cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you’re with me and the way you will show
And you’re with me wherever I go
And you give me this feelin', this everglow


Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feelin', this everglow


So if you love someone, you should let them know

And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis

A spider web is tangled up with me

A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done


And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm


Oh no, I see

Everyone falls, everybody dreams and doubts
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out


How in the world am I going to see
You as my brother, not my enemy?


'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone sees the colour in each other's eyes
Everyone loves, everybody gets their hearts ripped out
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out

Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized


It's easy to be lethal
I'm learning from the news
It's a guidebook for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People want to choose
They just see it from different views


And threading the needle
Fixing my flame
Oh now I'm moved to exclaim
Oh again, and again


How I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes

All I can think about is you
If all that I'm on earth to do
Is solo, then what a lone poor shoe
I want to walk in a two




Go!
It's all I can
It's all I can

From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low


If you love me, won't you let me know?


Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze


And if you love me, won't you let me know?




I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below


So if you love me, why'd you let me go?


I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?"
556,"In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah

Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah


Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it


I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I wait for it
And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah


Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it


Sing it please, please, please
Come back, come sing to me
To me, me
Come on and sing it out

Carved in your name with my pocket knife

Feels like there's something broken inside


All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
Whenever you go
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts


Got a tattoo and the pain's alright, oooh oooh
Just wanted a way of keeping you inside

All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire below
All I know
Is that I love you so
So much that it hurts


I see the road begin to climb
I see your stars begin to shine
I see your colors
And I'm dying of thirst
All I know is that I love you so

They were sitting on the strawberry swing

Cold, cold water
What ya say?


When it's such
It's such a perfect day
It's such a perfect day


I remember
We were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't wanna change a thing


People moving all the time
Inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna just curve away


When it's such
It's such a perfect day

I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue

I haven't slept
I think I do, but
I don't forget

Goes where I will

My heart stays still
It never moves

You're always in my head

Oh, and I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on


He said I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside me, baby, watch the orange glow
Some will laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why
So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war

And I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head

Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace

Meet me on the road
Meet me where I said

I had it once, I lost it though
And all along the fire below
Would rise

But one last time


Tell me you love me
If you don't, then lie
Oh, lie to me


Remember once upon a time
When I was yours and you were blind
The fire would sparkle in your eyes
And mine


So tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Oh, lie to me
Just tell me you love me
If you don't then lie
Oh, lie to me
If you don't then lie

Now I met you
And, honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you

I think you should know

In the swirling of the storm

But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on

I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight


I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart


As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony


And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh


So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise the flag

Every teardrop is a waterfall

That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say—


Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you


Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
For you I will always be waiting


And it's you I see, but you don't see me
And it's you I hear so loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you


So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me"
574,"What can I tell you?
When I'm with you, I'm walking on air
Watching you sleeping there, yeah
And what can't I get through?
When for everyone, everywhere
You're answering every prayer


And when you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're setting your sail
Oh, can I be your seventh sea?
When you're riding a wave
Oh, when you're riding a wave


'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I'll go to your church
'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I'll go to your church




When you're riding a wave

أبي يا الله يا قادر
حرية يا الله
محبة يا الله






I worship in your church, baby, always
I worship in your church, all the seven days 

I praise and praise



"
575,"A warning sign
I missed the good part then I realized
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses


Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign


When the truth is I miss you
Yeah, the truth is that I miss you so


A warning sign
It came back to haunt me and I realized
That you were an island and I passed you by
And you were an island to discover


Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign


When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so

No better and no worse

Every door I ever tried was locked

In a little pond

A bigger one

Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?


Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up


All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand


Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me


All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah when you see it then you'll understand


All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent


Birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand"

Verse
 1]
We were just about to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History has some to know
We were moving at the speed of flight
Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight


Just an alien


We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says


Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line


Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again


Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home


Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
For a lifetime
Just an alien
Moving target
Target movement
Oh, we just want to get home again
A patch, a corner
Of the spacetime
Just an alien
Turning toward it
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien"
583,"We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof put your hand in mine
""Life has a beautiful, crazy design""


And time seemed to say
""Forget the world and its weight""
And here I just wanna stay
Amazing day, amazing day


We sat on a roof, named every star
You showed me a place where you can be who you are


And the view; the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms, I just wanna sway
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oooh

Can the birds in poetry chime?
""Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?""

Cause now I always want to feel this way


Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Yeah, today"

See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus, see success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed, prepare to be crucified
 

Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you're ghetto

And it's done


But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oooh-ooh


From the top of the world, top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost, we would have been saved
Oh, I
Now we're stopping the world, stopping its spin
But, come on, don't give up, don't say we give in
Don't say it's over, don't say we're done

So before it's over, before you run

Tell me how you feel

Close your eyes and see
And we'll be birds, flying free
Holding on in the mystery
Fearless, fearless, fearless

Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart, she left a hole
The tightrope that I’m walking just sways and ties
The Devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in


And sing
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world


Like a river to a raindrop, I lost a friend
My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight, I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don’t let go
And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
Lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain, saying


Slow it down
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world


Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world"

You become my best friend
I wanna love you
But I don't know if I can

Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming, I can hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Every road is a ray of light
It goes on, time only can lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night

Love to the loveless shown
And it goes on
You don't have to be alone


Your heavy heart
Is made of stone

You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own


And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
Can I get that message home?

My song is love unknown

You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own


And I'm not gonna take it back

You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home


And I'm not gonna stand and wait
I'm not gonna leave it until it's much too late

That I'm nothing on my own

A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been

So I start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out


And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
Her soul slides away
But don't look back in anger
I heard you say


Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock'n'roll band
Who'll throw it all away


I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, the summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

Who couldn't live without
Ooh, come apart without it


On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn child
And at full tilt
And in full flight
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight

Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Stray dogs to welcome him, fights, corrugate cathedrals
The sight of the pilgrims going nowhere in millions of cars


Lagos a dream in the distance
From promises he'd made behind
Where there was no harvest
But he missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars


In Africa
The rivers are perfectly deep
And beautifully wide
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, ""It's alright, child
It's alright""


Yeah
Ah-hmm
Ah-hmm
[Chorus: 
Chris Martin and Tiwa Savage

In Africa
We dance in the water and hold
Each other so tight
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, ""It's alright, child
It's alright""

And dreamed of his queen by his side
There'll be a beautiful sunset
And you'll be a beautiful bride"

He had my back
Once he really saved my life

I see you, you
When I close my eyes, when I close my eyes
You come through, you

Sweetens and mends

We all melt back into the picture
Raindrops back into the water
Old friends

And there are no ends to old friends

Keep the car running, there’s no need to park
He’s not going to make it, through the night…
Keep that wedding cake in the fridge
He didn’t pay me back for using the bridge
I’m afraid this wedding won’t be white…
Boom, boom, boom, babba dippi dum
Boom, boom, boom, babba dippi bum


Red wedding, red wedding
Lots of stabbing and a bit of beheading
The Rains of Castamere are here to stay…
Red wedding, dead wedding
A head, shredding, bloodshed wedding
There will be no wedding bedding, hey
You don’t mess around with Walder Frey!"

You disappear

Just a whisper in a puff of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear

A thorn without a rose
Something people fear

Standing, by the wall 

And the guns, shot above our heads 

And we kissed, as though nothing could fall

Every sign just seems unclear

Remember Ned Stark, he was a lot of fun. 

But he didn’t make it past Season One 

Robert Baratheon was part of that crew
But he never made it to Season Two
The King of the North was cool, you said 

Another favorite that ended up dead 

You thought that Joffrey had to survive
He ain’t in the credits for Season Five 

Baby, you know I’m the man for all seasons
Characters get cut for various reasons 

Some people’s parts just ain’t that long
But not me

Drums, here it comes
Don't you wish that life could be as simple
As fish swimming round in a barrel?
When you've got the gun
Oh when I run, here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get behind a kind of control

Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they're thrown
Into the fire

Call comes in on the radio
Over you go
And red now, all the rivers flow
The poppies grow

Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset

Because I’ve only got one
I miss my fingers
Like you miss your son
Are you thinking about Joffrey?
Such a spirited lad
I was his uncle
I was also his dad
Around the world
My heart had to roam
Now I’m looking for something
A little closer to home
Closer to home
Closer to home
A family tree
With a branch of our own
Closer to home
Closer to home
Ensuring our family
Stays on the throne"
644,"

Oh, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial
And I should, but I can’t let you go


But when I’m cold, cold
Yeah, when I’m cold, cold
There’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There’s a feelin' within me, everglow


Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
Ye' we swore on that night we’d be friends 'til we die
But the changin' of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the fallin' of snow
And I’m gonna miss you, I know


But when I’m cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know you’re always with me and the way you will show
And you’re with me wherever I go
And you give me this feelin', this everglow


Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feelin', this everglow


So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow




God is watching me
God is- God don't praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don't give nothin' about Joe Frazier
God don't care nothin' about England or America as far as real wealth… it's all His
He wants to know how do we treat each other?
How do we help each other?
So, I'm gon' dedicate my life to usin' my name and popularity to helpin' charities, helpin' people, unitin' people
People bombin' each other because of religious beliefs
We need somebody in the world to help us all make peace
So when I die – if there's a heaven – I'm gonna see it"

Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it

In a permanent state, a permanent state

Starlight filled the evening

Simple tunes that tried to hide it

Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down

And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart, well it broke again
Time so vicious
Singing, the deeper that the knife goes in the more you win
You end up with less than when you begin
The deeper that the knife goes in

♪ Welcome to the crazy, wacky world of  Game of Thrones. ♪


- Nice, I like it.


- Thanks man, cool.


In an exclusive Red Nose Day revelation, we've discovered that the British band, Coldplay, are secretly working on a musical of TV sensation, Game of Thrones.


This is the best idea we've ever had.

Wait, wait, how many poppadoms?
They're ""babadoms"".


The band had been long-time fans of the show, and bearded drummer, Will Champion, actually took time off at one point to act in the famous 'Red Wedding' episode.
They've gathered in the Henson recording studio in Los Angeles to work up the 16 songs required for a full Broadway stage production.




- Nice! Have you got any lyrics?


- Yeah.


♪ Around the world my heart had to roam ♪


Well, when I first heard about it, I was, er, a little bit sceptical, but now I'm completely convinced: it's a horrible idea.

It's the worst idea I've ever heard.


♪ A family tree ... ♪




One word that springs to mind when I'm thinking about this project is ""Titanic."" But not in terms of the successful movie, uh, in terms of the unsuccessful boat.


♪ Closer to home ♪




Cut to: RAK Studios, London


Finally, after months of writing and planning, Chris has invited along the entire cast of Game of Thrones, to recruit them into the live Broadway show.


Fella's, how ya doin'?


I had a moment of inspiration, it was
a flash of genius -- get the whole cast to come in. Everyone thought it was a brilliant idea, so that's what's happening. It's a big day, big day for us.


All the actors are gathering to hear the songs performed for the first time.


Well, not all of them.


More ... two.


I was told Sean Bean was gonna be here. He owes me a fiver.


Well, no, I don't think it is quite as many as the band would have hoped, but ... still a very exciting day!


This is called ""Rastafarian Targaryen.""


- Yep!
♪ Ya-ya-ya-ya! ♪
♪ I'mma Rastafarian Targaryen ♪
♪ I got some dragons and they're
pretty scary-en ♪


So Chris, how you think it's going?


Stunning. Stunning.  People are literally stunned.


And what if some of them can't sing?


Well, the funny thing is, they can sing.


A two, three, four!


♪ Bom, bom, bom baba


Robert.... Robert! Snappy! Come on.


No, no, I-sorry, sorry.


I'm sure he'll come back.


Well, with these things it's always step by step. Um, 50% of the cast seemed really into it, so, um... I think we're onto something really special.




It's been a slightly disappointing day. But then...


Hey Chris. I'm sorry I'm late.


Oh my god. Jon Snow. I knew you'd come.


I'd never let you down, man.


Thank you, Jon Snow.


It's Kit.


Thank you, Kit Snow.


Right. What we got, man?




- Right... right... More volume please, more volume, turn it up a bit!




♪ Still going strong ♪




It's day two of the workshop, and suddenly things take a turn for the better. With a phone call from Jon Snow, and the offer of free food, a huge chunk of the cast have arrived.




- Hey man! Good to see you, man!


- Hi, how ya doin'? You too.


- Love your shirt, mate. Love your shirt.


- You look great.




It's been a very emotional morning.


I'll have the nuggets, please.


Yep, there's one left.


Oh, lovely!


Ahh ... I sense this choice will not end well for you. I would suggest the drumsticks.


Oh. Oh, right, well, drumsticks it is, then, apparently. Cheers.


I'll have the nuggets, please. Thank you.

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits


She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss

Somebody I can miss

Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so
History has some to know
We were moving at the speed of flight


Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight


Just an alien


We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says


Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line

Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again


Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
For a lifetime


Just an alien
Moving target
Target movement
A patch, a corner
Of the spacetime
Just an alien
Turning toward it
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again"

I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright, I feel good
So I'll go, and I'll try to stop moving

Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow sparkle


And our hearts were singin'
It felt like Christmas time

I think of you wherever you go
2000 miles is very far through the snow

I shut the world outside until the lights come on

Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I’m on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight




I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don’t want to see another generation drop
I’d rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I’m in the black, maybe I’m on my knees
Maybe I’m in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart


As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
And every tear’s a waterfall, is a waterfall

 And I can't decide

 All my wrong from right

 Or my day from night

How infinite is space
And who decides your fate
Why everything will dissolve into sand
How to avoid defeat
Where truth and fiction meet
Why nothing ever turns out as you plan

What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Pilots, up and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

We're as blind as each other


On the cloud that you're sitting
There's one born every minute
So much to discover
I've become a believer


Sisters and brothers
Who fight one another
Will mourn and deceive us
Will find us and keep us
Take us or leave us


How soon is now?
Only how long is never?
I'm nothing but normal

Take a picture of
Something that you're not sure of
Bring it back to show to me

Getting nowhere on your own
Got to find your missing piece

You tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored

I'm trying to sing a song
In a language I don't speak
I tried but I can't get through
I'm trying to get to you

Won't you talk to me?

Well he ain't got no Christmas tree


Well they say, Christmas here is so much fun

Christmas here's sweet as a peach
Opening presents on the beach
We got barbies, we got beer
Santa wishes he lived here
Loads of laughter, loads of booze
Christmas with the kangaroos


Well have you ever stopped to wonder how they do Christmas there down under?
Have you ever stopped to think ""Do they have much pumpkin drink?""
Oh don't you just find it shocking?
Have you got Tim Tams in your stocking?
Do you wonder where Jesus was born?
No, they got Kylie, they got Shane Warne


They all say Christmas here is so much fun

702,"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world, there's room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. The kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure!
A wonderful adventure!

In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean


Oh, I think I landed

For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds


Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
You get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life, I’ve just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams


Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
Now you've got me open-handed
Now you've got me lost for words

Busy hours turned into days, we were 



I got drunk but fell in love
Love is a lethal drug
I got drunk and took too much
Love is a lethal drug


All summer we belong to the way we let it on
Feeling slowly sinking in, lying back and watching heaven spin
In my head the parrot saw
Biomorphic thick in the stars
I don't know what else to win
Just give me one, give me one more hit 



I got drunk but fell in love
Love is a lethal drug
Fell down and picked it up
Love is a lethal star
I just can't give you up, but you're coursing through my blood
I just couldn't get enough, love is a lethal drug
Love is a lethal drug




Just went up in smoke

Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up
Up and up

See a bird soaring high above the flood

Sitting with the poison takes away the pain

Puede ser tarde
Let's go
[Verse 2: Will Champion & 
Chris Martin

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I wait for it
And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah
¿Cómo se canta? Let's go
[Chorus: Will Champion, 
Will Champion & Chris Martin

Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

712,"The cardboard head I see
Has found its way to me
It's old and it's old and it's old
Making me cry
I sleep but I will not move
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated
Oh no


What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear you say to me, ""It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things from which you can't escape""


Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others
Oh no


What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear you say to me, ""It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things which you cannot explain""


And it's making me cry love
And it's making me cry
And I'm slipping away love
And I'm slipping away


It's only superstition, only your imagination
It's only superstition, only superstition"
713,"Oh, when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you
Oh, I once was lost and now I'm found
I'm gonna do what I should do
And when I get back on my feet again
I'm gonna run my way to you
Oh, when all is lost and come undone
I'm gonna sing out, and see ya through
But no, the water
The water flows over
Oh, when I get back off my feet again
I'm gonna crown my days a turn
So all I've been on my knees again
And I'll do it all the time
And when I get back on solid ground
I'm gonna crawl my way to you
Oh, I once was lost, but now I'm found
So here's what I'm gonna do
I sing, oh, the water
The water flows over
I sing, oh, the water
The water flows over you"
714,"I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list


But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss


I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits


She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss

715,"Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh


Once upon a time, somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I've got to go, I've got to go
Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh


Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2: Rihanna 
& Chris Martin
]
Once upon a time, we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on
Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game
And why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw water on my flame


I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring

As far as poetry

Siento señor
No hablo bien español
El idioma del sol
Porque soy idiota
Pero hay una canción
Dentro de mi corazón
Les cuento con emoción
Algo explota


Del amor, soy explorador
Busca alrededor
Por todo mi vida
Pero señor
Aquí la búsqueda terminó
Viví el amor
En Argentina


Ahora la historia de nuestra gira mundial
Empezamos aquí
Acabamos aquí
Porque en este lugar
Este lugar es profundo
Yo decidí
Y luego aprendí
Amor, para todo el mundo


Del amor, soy explorador
Busca alrededor
Por todo mi vida
Pero señor
Aquí la búsqueda terminó
Porque viví amor
En Argentina
¡Todos!
Porque del amor soy explorador
Pero viví el amor

Or so it seems
One life for yourself
And one for your dreams
You drift through the years
And life seems tame
'Til one dream appears
And Love is its name
And love is a stranger
Who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger
Or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true

And love is a stranger
Who'll beckon you on
Don't think of the danger
Or the stranger is gone
This dream is for you
So pay the price
Make one dream come true
You only live twice"

Cause I'm falling and I can't get back
And there isn't any number I can call for that
Oh, help me out, help me out
Cause I fall, and I was so scared
I know what was severed, and I'm rolling in
Even when the sun set
It burned my eyes
Even when the dark
Began to climb
And just because I roll the dice
And turned to worse
Together for the grace of God
Don't know why"

Well, you're going to give a cause when the rain washed up
Well being just there with the gypsy talking to my friend
But you'll never get with it if you don't get respect
Oh well you'll never get with it if you just want respect


But sometimes the money's going to run out
And you'll be standing on the corner with a belly full of doubt
Sometimes somebody's going to bring you down
And you'll be standing on your own with a bucket for a crown


Well me and the boys were standing thinking we were hip
I don't wanna be the captain of a sinking ship
Well me and the boys in a town where the Mormon go
Listening to a session by Noel Gallagher
I was listening to a session by Noel Gallagher


They said sometimes your money's going to run out
And you'll be standing on a corner with a belly full of doubt
Oh someday somebody's going to bring you down
And you'll be standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown
Oh you'll be standing on a corner, just waiting on a corner
Standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown"
727,"This being human is a guest house
Every morning, a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows
Who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture
Still, treat each guest honorably
He may be clearing you out for some new delight
The dark thought, the shame, the malice
Meet them at the door laughing and invite them in
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide from beyond"
728,"All winter, we got carried
Away over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer, we just hurried

And don’t worry"

These particular diamonds were extra special
And though you might be gone, the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial
And I should, but I can't let you go


But when I’m cold, cold
Yeah, when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There's a feeling within me of everglow


Like brothers in blood, or sisters who ride
Yeah, we swore on that night, we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And now, I'm gonna miss you, I know


But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
I know you're always with me and the way you will show
You're with me wherever I go
But you give me this feeling, this everglow


What I wouldn’t give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow


So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you give me will everglow


God is watching me
God is, God don’t praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don't give nothin’ 'bout Joe Frazier
God don't care nothing about England or America as far as real wealth, it's all His
He wants to know how do we treat each other?
How do we help each other?
So, I’m going to dedicate my life to using my name and popularity to helping charities, helping people, uniting people, bring...
People bombing each other because of religious beliefs
We need somebody in the world to help us all make peace
So when I die, if there's a Heaven, I wanna see it"

Black market contraband
And it hurt just a little bit
When they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat
Two hands around the throat

And not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control?
Oh, if you hear can you let me know
How can they invade it
Oh, when it's so complicated?
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes


That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you heard?
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna get hurt
Oooh


Is there's something missing
There's nobody listening
Are you're running in a circle
How can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man-trapped
We don't wanna be shrink-wrapped
Oh, just wanna get it right sometimes
We just wanna get it right sometimes


That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard

Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up
I see a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood
Underneath the storm, an umbrella is singing
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up, it's saying

Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower

Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon

736,"I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart


As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony


And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh

Every tear

So you can hurt, hurt me bad

The wheel breaks the butterfly

I was very very sad to hear
My favourite show would disappear, and
Today I'm filling up with blues
Though I'm happy that her tummy's growing
A DJ that we love is going
How'm I gonna make it from 10 through to 1?
And how'm I gonna tell her we'll miss her a tonne?
How to tell her thanks for the records she played?
Thanks for introducing us to Lana del Rey
Thanks for the stories and all the good times
Festival tales, Kilimanjaro climbs
Thanks for all the mornings, in the Lounge we'd arrive
And sweetly you'd tell us, ""No swearing, we're live!""
Oh 
Fearne
 you made all of my mornings fly
Like the sun bursting through a cloud, into a cloudy sky
And you'll be great at anything that you wanna try
Now it's hard, but it's time for us to say goodbye
Bye Fearne"

When it starts you should never stop
No
Oh ten to the dozen
Who does, who doesn't
Who chooses who's chosen
Who must, who musn't
Who rests and who runs out
Don't ask that question
When your world's turned upside down
Oh when your world's turned upside down
I can it feel sink
I said i'd never do that again
Oh can you catch it now?
Oh like a bullet in your mouth
Like a balls and a ball of chain
Spark on another rain

I can feel it in my mouth

Who does, who doesn't
Who chooses who's chosen
Who must who mustn't
Who rests and who runs out
Don't ask that question
When my world's turned upside down

Pieces that begin to

Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Be a cartoon heart

Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We’ll run wild
We’ll be glowing in the dark

Glowing in the dark
Whoo, whoo


All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning goes
We’ll run riot
We’ll be glowing in the dark

Luminous and wired
We’ll be glowing in the dark

I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one"

Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees

Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can’t be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing


You are
You are


Confusion that never stops
The closing walls and ticking clocks
Are gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that, but you now know
So I come out upon the seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singing

The other boys in school
I tried my best to get it right

Still the sign upon my headstone, write
""A champion of the world""


Yeah


I tried my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best to stay in fight
But my rocket ship won't work
No, referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
Still I'll stand before conquistadors
Till I'm champion of the world


And when I sail, I'm sailing west
Knowing I might fail, but still I'm hoping for the best
In in my dreams, onto my chest
She'll pin the colours and say:
""I wandered the whole wide world but
Baby, you're the best""

When you love someone, but it goes to waste

Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me
In my scarecrow dreams
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose, come burst in the concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, fire the spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart, we'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
At first, it was easy
But now why's it have to be so hard?
Heaven is a fire escape
You try to cling to in the dark
At first it was simple
But now it got too complicated
But the world just got a lovely time
Or blame it all on my mistake
Maybe I'll find heaven

Maybe you'll find heaven is a place to part?

""Give me time, give me space, give me reason.""

Change your mind every night like the seasons
You're insatiable

Give me the runaround 

Which one am I with now?
She's got seven personalities, every one's a tragedy


She wants to break up every night

Don't wanna wait until she finally decides to feel it

Been to France one time and you're Parisian
Joined the real world, new season
Check my phone, check my pulse, ain't a reason
I kinda love it though


And I know you say you need me now 

Give me the runaround

Ice cold, I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far I want to pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over


Ever since I left you, I’ve been trying to get you back
And it keeps getting worse
I’m burning on the inside and the truth is that I, didn’t know how good you were
Until you were gone
Until you were gone


I was always told that only time would heal the pain
Yet even though it’s been so long it still hurts just the same
Yet now I’m finding, that the break was binding
I take back everything I said, oh, won't you just come home


Ice cold I freeze up when I see ya

I started acting out when you moved on
I tried to call you to eliminate the distance
I cared about you once and always will


And I tried my best, crossed my fingers for the rest
And I will find a way, somehow
To be more than photos to you now
I blame myself for when I was someone else

Who the fuck is ""Drew from home"" anyway?
This vacation, you said, ""Going home was boring""
Left out that part of the story on your way
I might deserve it, but I can't take it
Maybe I should keep this to myself
'Cause if I'm honest, my record's less than flawless
You know that I get lonely when you're gone

That I only smoke papers, ‘cause I don’t smoke 'gars, babe
I’m at an old school car take a joint to the face
And we both go far
Get high, can’t stop
Let’s get high, we can’t stop
No

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Roll up a joint and take it to the brain
Say you're getting high, but now you're speaking my language
Left with me as soon as we came
Spoke some bullshit, she'll never do it again
Try anything, she'll never do it again
Fuck Khalifa man, 'cos you'll never do it again

That I've been here before
It's a certain type of fling, she gets bored of everything
Not the type you can ignore
Yeah, I just want a taste as she grabs me by the waist
As she closes the door
She's taking what she wants, baby, you can have it all

I drink too much and that's an issue but I’m okay

Left you just to find out that I need ya

I’m burning on the inside and the truth is that I, didn’t know how good you were
Until you were gone
Until you were gone


Didn’t know how good you were
Didn’t know how good you were
Until you were gone


I was always told that only time would heal the pain
Yet even though it’s been so long it still hurts just the same
Yet now I’m finding, that the break was binding
Let’s take back everything I said oh won't you just come home

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Arguments that never end
You're talkin' shit to spice up conversation
I’m so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are startin’ to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again
And grab my hand even though you hate it
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we’re good again
I do things I can't defend

Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it’s over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said

Hang onto burning wires

Are we fading lovers?
We keep wasting colors
Maybe we should let this go


We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know


I'll ride my bike up to the road
Down the streets right through the city
I'll go everywhere you go
From Chicago to the coast
You tell me, ""Hit this and let's go
Blow the smoke right through the window""
'Cause this is all we know


'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know
'Cause this is all we know


Never face each other
One bed, different covers
We don't care anymore
Two hearts still beating
On with different rhythms
Maybe we should let this go


We're falling apart, still we hold together
We've passed the end, so we chase forever
'Cause this is all we know
This feeling's all we know

I tried to put my finger on the moment we were wronged
But the taste turned bitter, so I pulled the trigger
Not so easy to move on, I guess I should have known


Ice cold I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far I want to pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over


Ever since I left you, I’ve been trying to get you back
And it keeps getting worse
I’m burning on the inside and the truth is that I, didn’t know how good you were
Until you were gone
Until you were gone


I was always told that only time would heal the pain
Yet even though it’s been so long it still hurts just the same
Yet now I’m finding, that the break was binding
Let’s take back everything I said oh won't you just come home


Ice cold I freeze up when I see ya
Left you just to find out that I need ya
So far I want to pull you closer
I wish we could start the whole thing over

I count the seconds


Down and down we go
We'll torch this place we know
Before one of us takes a chance
And breaks this, I won't be the one
No, I won't be the one


You know, I'm sorry




I know it's pathetic
Fuck it, yeah, I said it
Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so
Let's go, let's end this
I delete before I send it
And we can play pretend
Like we haven't reached the end yet

Can't believe that I see this, we're out of chances now

I know I'm super fly, I know I'm super fly"
982,"Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name


It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize


That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man


My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made 

And it haunts me every time I close my eyes


It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize


That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man


Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know


I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man


Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man"

Tell the devil I said, ""Hey"" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face,

Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful

You just killing off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don't get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors


The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are


When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change

Better make sure to lock her doors

And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side


We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted, but baby, what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you try


You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side


If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland, it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line, you can't change your mind
Yeah, I'm a monster, but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly, I've been feelin' insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was, you would run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line, and come back alive
But that's the price we paying when we living on the other side


You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other

I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins


Yesterday has come and gone
And I've learn how to leave it where it is
And I see that I was wrong
For ever doubting I could win


Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change 



I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins


Life's too short to have regrets
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
Only have one life to live
So you better make the best of it


I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking

Along came a train

On the street kickin' rocks
Circlin' the same block
Greenpoint to Flatbush
Checkin' every corner shop
Tappin' people's shoulders
Askin' if they know her
Every day’s the same

Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby


Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows


You've been living this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one you are looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see


Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows


All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I can't pretend
Wish we were more than friends


She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal 

A heart that can't feel 
, it's broken 

His love is all she knows 
, all she knows 
, all she knows 

His love is all she knows 
, all she knows 
, all she knows 

His love is all she knows"

How can a day be so long?

But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe


That for you, I do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again
For you


I missed the first train, stood out in the rain all day


But I caught the next train, and there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for


Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe


That for you, I do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again, oh

Could turn out so lovely
Yea, I am so glad I fine with you
Even though the day went so wrong
I wouldn't change a thing

She wanted someone that's perfect
OK, but can you tell me who Is?
Ooooh Oooh Ooh
Ooooh Oooh Ooh


She set the bar just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it but I still kept on reaching
She watched me try at least a thousand times
If she loved me she'd stopped me but no


I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day who is?
She wanted someone that's perfect
OK, but can you tell me who Is?


I saw something worth my future
So right, so wrong
In my mind I was all it took, but I guess I wasn't wrong?

I sit by myself...


Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too

Well I say let it out, holla like you Jane in the jungle
And let me climb that tower
Pulling on your hair like Rapunzel
Every now and then you like it rough
Sometimes you like it gentle
I just wanna make love all night
While we listen to the sounds of this instrumental
Treatin' your body like a cello, booty like hello
Jiggle like Jell-O
Love it whenever you get ghetto
When I leave your body smokin' like a cigarillo

Asking

Is a song that it means a lot to me


I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?


Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is


If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?


I don't need your honesty, it's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?


Now, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is


If this is my last night with you
You better hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?


Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask, all I ask is...


If this is my last night with you
You better hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love, never love
Never love, never love again?

Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me


As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life


Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies by when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait cause I finally found the one
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me


As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life"

Jumps in the shower
Then rubs on her lotion
While she is wrapped in a towel
Ain't no music on, but she dance to perfection
I swear the bathrooms the club
The way she's showing to her reflection


Every morning, I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep
But I don't miss a show


My favorite part of the day
Is when she dance in the mirror 

There's nothing more I can say

No, no

'Cause our love has never changed
But all the little things keep piling up
And life keeps getting in the way


Don't make it harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss?
And just let it go
And stop the madness before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes


Some things we won't understand
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood
So let's just turn and walk away
And hold on to what was good


Don't make it harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss?

That she do not really know
That I'm trying to find a way
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
So I. ..
I do not wanna be
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing shaking ground
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it

Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost
I'm already lost
I wish that I could see
What is making you
Feel that you Should be concerned
My love is like a Gunshot
All It takes is one shot for me to blow it all away
I do not wanna feel like I'm just wasting time
It's gotta be with you and no one else
Do you notice me
I need to know right now
Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it

Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost
Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl you make me nervous
Should you have by now noticed me
And what will it take it
To a heavenly Because your
Drawing chains and
Driving me insane!

But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me


I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run

Wipe those tears from your eyes it's too late
With that rag in your mouth can't tell what you say
Tied to the train tracks begging me for mercy
This is going to hurt you more than it hurts me
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me




You brought this upon yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch now shut up and take it
Look at the monster you created
You brought this up on yourself

You know, you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips, you know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals, oh
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you, and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free, oh
Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
I know
I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they knows that I’m not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright, oh
Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh
Oh-ooh moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Don't look down, don't you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone
Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh

Do not give up, keep on trying

 do not give up
Do not ever quit, try and try and you can do it, do not give up 



If you want to catch a ball, but you are having no luck at all
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose
It hits your belly, your chin and toes
Well try and try and try again, keep on trying and soon
You will put your hands out in the air
You will catch that 
ball
, yes this I swear


Do not give up, keep on going
You are on a boat, so keep on rowing
Do not give up, don’t ever stop
Try and try and you will come out on top, do not give up


You got yourself new roller-skates
You put them on and you feel great
Stand up, but then you fall
Do not think you can skate at all
You get back up and then you trip
You skip and tip and slip and flip
Well try and try and try some more
And soon you are skating across the floor


Do not give up, keep on moving
You are going to get there just keep on grooving
Do not give up, do not pack it in
Try and try and you will win, do not give up
No no no, do not give up
No no no, do not give up
No no no, do not give up, no no
Do not give up"

If I made my move
Then hand it for, she’s seconds away
Me and you touching, dancing the night away

I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine


Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine

Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you

1061,"Staring from my room I see them
Holding hands wish I could be them
Lovers doing what we use to do


That's the way it's been here lately
You're too busy now to save me
Feels like you forget I'm waiting for you
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you 

And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me


How do I always end up being the girl at the window


I tell myself I'm not going to wait for you whenever you go


You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I
Always end up that girl at the window 

The girl at the window


I know you're working that's why you're leaving
I will never argue your reasons
If this means that you believe in them
Oh time goes on and we're growing apart
Broken promises break my heart
Please don't give me a reason to say goodbye
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you 

And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me




How can I be what you're saying
When you keep turning all the pages
Am I supposed to believe your words are true
Don't take advantage of me cause you know I won't leave you
I make sure you know I always want to see you
Whoa won't you do it for me too


Oh how do I always end up being the girl at the window


I tell myself I'm not going to wait for you whenever you go


You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I
Always end up that girl at the window 

The girl at the window"
1062,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are

The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah"

On a big, old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honeys

'Til the birds start calling my name

Guess I've always been this way


All these roads steer me wrong

You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you


I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know


All these roads steer me wrong

He got a long wrapped sheet, that's right my baby aren’t scared
And when he talks that talk, he can back it up, ooh
And when he comes there to it, can nobody come between our love
I know some girls like good boys
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go


Oh no
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'm going to take you home even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare


He drinks his Jack with no Cola, 'cause he likes to feel the burn
His middle finger to the law, no this boy will never learn
Everything wrong about him, yeah, it turns me on, oh
We live the good life, sleep all day and party all night long
I know some girls like good boys
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go




Say what you want, but this boy gives me everything
He'll never hurt me or put me off, anything
Mama don't you be scared, your baby girl is grown
And now I've fallen in love





You may be my mama's worst nightmare
But you're my dream come true"

You don't know how I feel
Cause I am usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal

But I cannot hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Cannot wait no more

It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you

Maybe I am a fool for speaking up but I do not mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do
And the look that you are giving me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I will change my ways I will
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothing to lose
I have got nothing to lose

Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you
I am all about you


Girl when you smile
Not a place I would rather be
Just stay for a while
Then you will see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That is why I have to take this time baby to tell you

Our bodies are yearning

I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on
Can I move on
Oh


When I am weak it's you that makes me strong
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart
With you life is so easy why do I make it hard
Oh taking roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first


Hey!
I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on


I get out of my own way, let you have your way
Cause I realize I'm no good on my own
I'm there for you, I'll serve for you
I can't live without you. No


I come to you now when I need you, why do I wait to come see you

:
Alright, I do this for all of you
I make music for love, the love of everything
J. Reyez... Bruno Mars...
C'mon!
Verse 1 
:
When I wake up next to you girl
It's like a dream and I'm stuck in two worlds
You're beautiful and you're always shining
Your happiness to me is worth more than diamonds
Many people are there, but you're worth keeping
The same letters, three words and one meaning
I love you, but we have our little arguments
That don't stop untill we forgot who started it
I blank out and the thoughts around in me
You and I, everytime you smiled at me
And I'm blessed, god's gift to me is you
Your eyes, the world I see in you
And time never goes to waste
Don't change, cuz you can never be replaced
This love, you can never rearrange
Everytime when I see your face
Refrain 
:
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Verse 2 
:
Just the way you express with ""ing"" girl
You're nothing short of my everything
And every memory so sentimental
Your happiness is my essential
This a way for me to say thanks
No stress, I want you to give me strenght
When I'm hurting, you're so close to perfect
But to the world you're just one person
But to that person you mean the world is just
How we ride, me and my girl, uhh
We do this Bonnie and Clyde shit
We fall together, we coincided
The way to my heart it was hard to find it
But you found dead deep down inside of this love
You can never rearrange
Everytime when i see your face
Refrain 
:
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are Girl you're amazing, just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

1070,"Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live
Oh take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya Throw my head on a blade for ya 

I'd jump in front of a train for ya 

You know I'd do anything for ya 

Oh whoa oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same
No no no no
Black, black, black and blue
Beat me {til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman that's just what you are

When I was just a little boy
Barely strong enough to stand
I could always count on him
Oh
He thought me everything I know
And 'till this day it shows
He was more than just a friend 



There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help


How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't
Oh
Never say you can't
Oh oh oh Oh


So when last rain begins to fall
And you're out there on your own
And you can't see a thing
No no no
Just find a voice that understands
For me it was my old man
Taught me to say the words I can
Oh


There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help


How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't


Everything he taught me would stay with me forever
No I won't forget a thing
Oh because of dad I now know myself better
And I hope I can do for him what he did for me


How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall

Never say you can't"

I’m going to take you to the top girl, hey
Top of the world. You ready?
Come on 



I feel higher than the ceiling
Cause I'm floating on this feeling
So long my feet have been up off the floor
Destiny is what I call it
My Heart's for sale and girl you bought it
The moment that you walk right through the door ooh


Till the day that I stop living
Girl my love I won't stop giving
Cross my heart and hope to die my love is yours
And I pray girl that this feeling
Is something that we always feeling

I know I've been wrong about these things
I don't care if no one else believes
I think that if you believe it then maybe we'll make it
Tonight
Oh tonight
If you believe in me like I believe in you
Tonight
Tonight
Because impossible is possible tonight


Some about the day
Some about the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
Low like Kesha when she on the mic
Move on to another because she wasn't treated right
I could relate to that boy Drizzy
How did I wind up right here with you

you can achieve if you do believe
Got to chase your dreams true reality
No fantasy enjoy it while you have it
Relax and take it in
I tell as your friend your friend to the end




Some about the day

Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
We could get together like it's New Year’s Eve
Met a lot of girls but is you what I need
I live life fast
Trying to hang on passenger
I need a companion on this campaign
Felt so much pain when the rain goes away believe in sunny days
One life to live got to be epic or I'll be Edward you can be my Bella

1074,"Got me going in circles c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night

You won't come through
Got me going in circles c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Round and r-r-r-round we go 

Round and r-r-r-round
I'm going in circles c-circles
Please girl!


I give you everything, but, it's not enough
You started being easy but lately you've made it rough 

You say you need me but then turn me away
Got me oh so confused, should I leave or should I stay?

 A little more time

 Baby all your love

 All the way

 Make up your mind

1075,"I feel like dancing the night away
Feels like just yesterday we danced for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh


Let's let the music keep our bodies awake
Feels like I'm touching you right now for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh


I think i might explode, this tension is so cold
And all this fighting between us is really getting old
We need a magic touch, before it all blows up
We've both had enough, we've both had enough
So let's just get away, go to that special place
Where we first met and on the floor my feet were swept away
Baby it's worth a try, I believe in you and I
Only takes just one night


Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again






Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again
Ooh

You see, music make her dance

I’ll sail the world to find you

When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me
Like 1, 2, 3
I’ll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you

You’ll be there
’Cause that’s what friends are supposed to do
If you’re tossin’ and you’re turnin’
And you just can’t fall asleep

If there's something i'm not doing, girl i'm trying

That doesn’t mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad
You should know, these
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby 

Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking ""maybe I should get it out""
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
These
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby 

Nothing on you, baby
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby 

Nothing on you, baby

A little bit bigger now

Dont sound the same
When our friends talk
About you all it does is just
Make a sound

My heart feels the same
When i hear your name
It all just sounds like
Ooh oh ooh oh ooooh
Mmmm too young too dumb
Too realize that you should have
Bought me flowers and held
My hand should have gave me all
Your hours when you had the chance
Take me too every party because all
I wanted to was dance now im really
Dancing but im dancing with
Another man
*Verse 2*
Your pride your ego and
Your selfish ways caused a good
Strong woman like me too walk out
Your life now you never never
Get to clean up the mess you've made
Ooh

And it haunts you every time
You close your eyes it all just
Sounds likeooh oh ooh oh ooooh

Take me too every party because all

Be the first to say that
You were wrong oh know
Your probably much too late
Too try and apologize for your
Mistakes but i just want you
Too know i hope you buy her
Flowers i hope you hold her hand
Give her all your hours when you
Have the chance take her to every
Party cause all she wants to do
Is dance do all the things you should
Have done when i was your girl
Do all the things you should
Have done when i was your girl"
1098,"Bruno Mars
Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go about your day, baby
While I hide from the sun
It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I will be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
Cee-Lo
We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
B.o.B
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly I've been feelin' insane In between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we payin' when we livin' on the other side
Bruno Mars
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side

It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand"
1099,"And I don't mind when we fall out
As long as we fall back into it
I hope we never put an end to it
Even though you not that into it
Heaven, have you ever been to it?
Cause you look like you never been
You're more of a Hell's Angel
And for you, I'd rather sin
Broken heart, love you with a broken heart
For you I'd jump off Noah's arc
Love is blind and hope is dark
Why does pain feel so good?
Love is science live for you
Die for you, and I'll die smiling


Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand is


I'd catch a grenade for you, throw my hand on a blade for you
I'd jump in front of a train for you, you know I'd do anything for ya
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby, but you won't do the same
No, no, no, no


Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are, yeah
You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand is




If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But darling

I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and

'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys

It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that


I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah 



I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead


I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah 



People say ""believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear""
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me dear:
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know


I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
I heard it through the grapevine

And stand around
Cause I was too nervous
To really get down

I got up on the floor and thought
Somebody could choose me
No more standin' there beside the walls

And now I'm havin' a ball
As long as you're groovin'
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
Might wanna make romance
Move your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel alright

I give you all the love I want in return sweet darling

I want you—the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too

Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east


Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury


Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be, no no
Radiation under ground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying


Mercy, mercy me
Things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?"
1109,"Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny


With my arms open wide
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life to you
I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need


And when I lose my will
You'll be there to push me up the hill


There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, You're all I need to get by


Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me


Darling in you I found
Strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher


I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal


Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You're all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need to get by"

I'm just getting back, but you knew I would

When will people start getting together again?
Are things really getting better, like the newspaper said
What else is new my friend, besides what I read


Can't find no work, can't find no job, my friend
Money is tighter than, it's ever been
Say man, I just don't understand
What's going on across this land
Ah, what's happening brother?
Yeah, what's happening? What's happening my man?


Are they still getting down
Where we used to go and dance
Will our ball club win the pennant
Do you think, they have a chance?
And tell me friend, how in the world have you been?
Tell me, what's out and I want to know what's in


What's the deal man
What's happening? Tell me brother
What's happening brother?
Ah, what's happening brother?
What's happening my man?
Whoo, ah, ah, what's happening brother?

Taxes, death and trouble


This I know, baby, this I know, child
Yeah, let the sweat through you, baby
Got me singing, yeah, yeah, ooh


I come up hard, baby, I had to fight
Took care of my business with all my might
I come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over and win again
I come up hard, but that's OK
Because Trouble Man don't get in my way


I know some places and I've seen some faces
I got good connections aimed in my direction
When people say; that's OK, they don't bother me
I'm ready to make it, don't care about the weather
Don't care about no trouble, got myself together

Flying high without ever leaving the ground, no
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
Oh Lord, and have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger awaits me
And it's bound to forsake me
So stupid minded
I can't help it, so stupid minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it
In the morning, I'll be alright, my friend
But soon the night will bring the pains
The pain, awful pain


Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
And I ain't seen nothing but trouble baby
Nobody really understands, no, no
And I go to the place where the good feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hand
Oh Lord, so stupid minded
Oh and, I go crazy when I can't find it

To the boy who makes slaves out of men

Ooh, so many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn through the day


Distant lover 

You should think about me
Say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery
Misery


As I reminisce, ah baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road


Distant lover, ooh sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel
Didn't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you
I treasured it
Like it was precious a jewel, oh baby
Lord, have mercy


Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back, baby
Something I want to say
When you left you took all of me with you
My lord I wonder, do you want to hear me scream?

Come back home, little girl
Oh baby please, please"

1115,"I just want to ask a question:
Who really cares, to save a world in despair?
Who really cares?
There'll come a time 

When the world won't be singing 

Flowers won't grow 

Bells won't be ringing 

Who really cares? 

Who's willing to try? 

To save the world, 

That's destined to die 

When I look at the world 

It fills me with sorrow 

Little children today 

Are really going to suffer tomorrow 


 What a shame 

Such a bad way to live 

Oh, who is to blame? 

We can't stop living, 

Live, 


 Live for life


Live life for the children 

You see, let's...let's save the children
Let's...let's save all the children, 









But who really cares?
Who's willing to try?
To save our world
To save our sweet world
To save a world
That is destined...to die
Oh, la la la la, la la la
Oh, oh, dig it everybody"
1116,"Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn and
I thought that you were here with me
If you could only see how much I love you
You'd want to trust me
Oh, in my dream I was loving you
Every place that you wanted me to
Since I believe in dreams and fantasies
I'd like to make love to you right there baby
Ooh, I've got this real strong need to love you everywhere
I won't stop until I find your passions flowing like wine
Baby, baby, please let me do it to you



 I never, gave head before
But there's always the first time you know
So I made up my mind, soon I'll be loving you
That's all I'm interested in, I've made up my mind
Soon I'll be loving you, girl I know what I'm going to do
I can't wait to touch you, to give you that feeling
Eat you up my dear so that your mood will be revealing baby
And soon as I know I've got you willing baby
I'm going to give you some head baby
Giving up my life, keeping up the faith, that's what I'll do because I'm hung up on you 

I'm gone knock you right up woman
I'm going to give you some head, sugar, I know what to do
I want to give you some head
, ah you big fine woman
Woo, I love to give it, baby, because I know just what to do with it
Ah I'm going to give the ultimate love baby, the ultimate love baby
Don't you know I can handle you
Soon, soon, soon I'll be loving you,

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing.  No, no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Oh, honey
I got your picture hanging on the wall
But it can see or come to me when I call your name
I realized it's just a picture in a frame
Oooh, I read your letters when you're not here
But they don't move me and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear
Don't you know?
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I play my game of fantasy
I pretend, but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together.  I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of your being there
Oh
So glad we got the real thing, baby
So glad we got the real thing
Oh, Marvin.  

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.  


 Ain't nothing like the real thing
Talk to me
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.  


 Ain't nothing like the real thing"
1118,"Every day there's something new 

Honey, to keep me loving you 

And with every passing minute
Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it


Wo, Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love


And I, I've got a song to sing 

Telling the world about the joy you bring 

And you gave me a reason for living 

And ooo, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of giving


Wo, Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love


To find a love like ours is rare these days
Cause you've shown me happiness, yes, in so many ways
I look in the mirror, and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be
What you've given me I could never return 

Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn 

And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation 

Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration


Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love


Wo, Heaven must have sent you from above
Wo, heaven must have sent your precious love"
1119,"Hey baby, that's alright people
I know that's alright
Everyday, that's alright
Oh, when we love each other


I know that's alright
Oh just feel it, feel it
Oh everybody feel it
God know that's alright, yes


Some of us were born with money to spend
Some of us were born for races to win
Some of us are aware that it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind of poverty blowing in the air


For those of us who simply like to socialize
For those of us who tend the sick
And heed the people's cries
Let me say to you, right on


Turn on, on, feel it, feel
Yeah, oh, oh, oh Lord, Lord, people
And I say, right on
Honey, right on


For those of us who live where peace is craved
For those of us who live, where hatred is enslaved, alright
For those of us who live a life, yeah
Surrounded by good fortune and wealth, talk about it


For those of us who live a life, hey, hey, hey enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned in the sea of happiness
For the soul that takes pride in his God
And himself and everything else


Love, love, sweet love, love, wonderful love
Ah, true love, love, love for your brother
And love, love for God
Love, pure love


Ah true love can conquer hate every time
Give out some love and you'll find peace sublime
And my darling, one more thing
If you let me, I will take you to live where love is king
Ah, baby"
1120,"Come live with me, angel
Come live with me in comfort




I want to understand your moods, baby


I really, really


When you want some solitude, sugar


You can have it, ooh yeah baby


Darling, please walk around nude 

So I can get you baby
I want to intrude at least 

In all the ways baby, whoo
You can have your way if you decide to stay
So




Ooh, this is where all your fantasies end
Let me explore all your treasures
I'll turn you on to all of those freakish pleasures
Good experienced company
Like me who knows all the ways
Is what you need baby
Just you and me locked up for days
After we eat breakfast in bed
Turn on the music for our head




Oh, Angel, come on Go with me
Please, come on go with me
I said please
Sweet little thing
It's no mystery
How much I want you
I want you baby
I want you

Sweet, little sexy thing
I want you to live with me
Come on Sweet thing
Come on live with me, girl
Come on baby"
1121,"Wholy holy
Come together
Wholy holy
People, we all got to come together
Because we need the strength, power and all the feeling


Wholy holy
Oh Lord, get together, one another
Wholy holy
We should believe in one another
Jesus left a long time ago, said he would return
He left us a book to believe in, in it we've got a lot to learn
Oh yeah


Wholy
Oh Lord, we can conquer hate forever, we need him
Wholy
We can rock the world's foundation
Everybody together, together and holy
Will holler love, love, love across the nation


Oh, oh
Wholy holy
All together and holy
We proclaim love, our salvation
Oh, oh, ooo"
1122,"Sunny, yesterday my heart was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Oh, the dark days are done, and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Sunny one so true, I love you


Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel about ten feet tall
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you


Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see
Yeah sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z
Oh my life was torn like wind blown sand
Then a rock was formed when you held my hand
Sunny one so true, I love you
Yes, yes


Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
Oh you're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, I love you


Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
Oh you're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Oh, sunny one so true, I love you"
1123,"If this world were mine
I'd place at your feet all that I own
You've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
For with your love inside me, that would be all I need


If this world were mine
I'd give you anything


If this world were mine, I'd make you a king
With wealth untold, you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each day so sunny and blue
If you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too


If this world were mine
I'd give you anything
[Verse 3: Marvin Gaye & 
Tammi Terrell
]
Oh baby, you're my consolation
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, honey, just call me
And honey, you're my inspiration
And I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me
[Bridge: Marvin Gaye, 
Tammi Terrell
, 
Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell
]
Whoa oh oh oh
Every sky would be blue
As long as you're loving me
Whoa oh oh oh
With you here in my arms
Life is so wonderful


Whoa oh oh oh
Give me pretty loving, baby
Give me pretty loving, honey
Keep on loving me
Whoa oh oh oh
You know I need you, baby
Really, really need you, honey
Keep on loving me"
1124,"I guess I'd have to say this album is
Dedicated to you
Although perhaps I may not be happy
This is what you want
So I conceded
I hope it makes you happy
There's a lot of truth in it, babe
I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
To keep me in line
One thing I can't do without
Is the boy whom God gave to both of us
I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine
So here it is, babe
I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy
Think about the kisses and the joy
But there were those other moments too
The times that were cloudy and grey
Bad
But you taught me that was life
May love ever possess you
May peace come into your life
Always think of me the way I was
Ha, I was your baby
This is what you wanted
Here, dear, here it is
Here, my dear, here it is"
1125,"You were my wife, my life, my hopes and dreams
For you to understand what this means, I shall explain
I stood all the jealousy, all the bitching too
Yes, I'd forget it all once in bed with you
Ooo darling how could we end up like this?
Oh baby let me reminisce


Oh and when we, woo, stopped the hands of time
You set my soul on fire, my one desire
Was to love you and think of you with pride
And keep you satisfied, oh baby oh baby
We could not bear the mental strain
Leave you, I never meant to
Now you see how much you hurt me
But if you ever need me, I'll be by your side
Though the many happy times we had
Can never really outweigh the bad
Oh I'll never love nobody like I loved you baby


It's time for us to say farewell, farewell my darling
Maybe we'll meet down the line
It's too late for you and me, it's too late for you and I
Much too late for you to cry
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you and I
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry baby
Ah we tried, God knows we tried
Now it's too late to live and love and ah it's too late baby
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry
Oh oh ohhh it's much too late
Well, all we can do is, we can both try to be happy"
1126,"Oh, If I should die tonight
Oh baby, though it be far before my time
I won't die blue, sugar yeah
Because I've known you


Ooh, oh, how many eyes have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, darling, have felt their world stand still?


Millions never, they never never
And millions never will baby
They never will


If I should die tonight, love
Darling, far before my time
I won't die blue
Because I've known you


Ooh, I'm so grateful baby
Grateful that you're loving me
My desire
Is to love you 'til
I'm no longer here, and never tire
Love has been so good to me, me now
I'm so thankful


Ooh, oh, how many eyes have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, oh darling, have felt their world stand still?
Oh Lord

"
1127,"
 You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real
I mean, if you think back about what you really said about honor, loving and obeying till death do us part and all
But it shouldn't be that way, it should, it should, it should be lies because it turns out to be lies
If you don't honor what you said, you lie to God. The words should be changed


Ooh now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby
Ooh if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me with all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part


I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how hard I tried, really tried


We really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized, my name


What I can't understand is if you love me
How could you turn me in to the police
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could, you were so divine and your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears, enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, so break away to the new-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend; I'll never be back again
But I'm not really bitter, babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world
Good luck in the world
But I know you'll never be satisfied
No, you still want me standin' by your side
Memories haunt you all the time
I will never leave your mind
Got judgment on your side;
You've said bad things and you've lied
Still I remember some of the good things, baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life
I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared baby
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was
To love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter baby
Take a lesson from it all 

I never thought I'd see the day when
You'd put me through what you put me through
You tried your best
You say I gave you no rest


When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?"
1128,"Has anyone here seen my old friend Abraham?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
Oh, he freed a lot of people
But it seems the good die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone


Has anyone here seen my old friend John?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
You know, he freed a lot of people
But it seems the good die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone


Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people
But it seems the good die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone


Has anybody here seen my friend Bobby?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
You know, he freed a lot of people
But the good, they die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone
Oh I, just looked around and they were gone"
1129,"Yeeeeah...
I gotta help the world
Yeeeeah...
Oh listen... Someone is friendless, cannot find their way
So I'll, keep my light in my window
I want to be there, to help restore their faith
So I'll, keep my light in my window
Born of God's mercy
I'd be in their place
So I'll, keep my light in my window
I wanna ease the pain, 

Help them find a peace, mmm 

Have been chosen for 

To make this world a much better place
For me and you

 to lend a helping hand
So I'll, keep my light in my window
I feel so good when I help my fellow man
So I'll, keep my light in my window
Till love and mercy are spread throughout the land
So I'll, keep my light in my window
I wanna ease the pain, 

Help them find a peace, mmm 

Have been chosen for 

To make this world a much better place
For me and you
Whoooo
I've gotta help the world... mmmmmm
Ease the pain well 

Help them find a peace 

Have been chosen for 

To make this world a better place
For me and you
Ease the pain yeah 

Help them find a peace 

Have been chosen for 

To make this world a better place
For me and you
Ease the pain 
 that life can bring
Help them find a peace 
 their spirit needs
Have been chosen for 
 a work to do
To make this world a better place 
 for me and you
To make this world a better place 

For me and you 

To make this world a better place 

For me and you

 To make this world a better place
For me and you

 To make this world a better place 

For me and you
To make this world a better place
For me and you"
1130,"Girl, you've been gone away a real long time
I nearly went out of my mind
I miss your loving when you left, baby you did


Ah baby, come here, let me caress you
Ah ah baby your letters told me what you missed
Come here, sugar, and get to this
Ah baby, I want you here
I want to do something freaky to you
I want to feel what I've felt a long time ago
Ah come, baby, and get to this


Ooh, remember, baby, how you made me feel just like a king
Ah, I can’t wait, baby
I'm ready for you to start doing the things
I’m trying to blow your mind
You're so fine, so petite, oh candy sweet
Ah, I can’t wait
Come here, come here, baby, get to this


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sweet love, sweet love, oh so good
To have you back, everything else will have to, to get back
Oh, nothing's changed, you're still sweet as morning rain
And I'm standing ready to
Love you, baby, make it good to you


Ohhh, I need your love
Don't make me wait, I can't wait
Oh, I'm so impatient for your love
Come here, sweet sweet baby, get to this


Girl, I know you've been gone a real long time
You nearly blew my mind, baby
Girl, you've been gone for so long
I'm so glad, babe, so glad that you’re home, oh baby"
1131,"Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain


Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be


You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby 'till I don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger  



Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity, hey, hey


I cried so much just like a child that's lost its toy
Maybe baby you think these tears i cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears 

Now ain't that peculiar baby?
Peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar, honey?
Peculiar as can be
Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes
Ain't it peculiar, darling?"

I walked the longest mile
For the darkest while
And it killed my heart
To see my people down
They call me crazy eyes
I have a troubled mind
And a cardboard sign
And a jug of wine
But I'll be alright
If I can make it through the night
Say can you spare some change
I'm not the dangerous type
Just a hard-hit friend
With an empty pipe
And when the morning comes
I struggle in the light
But I'll be alright
If I can just get high
Said I'll be alright
If I can just get high
Take a look at my crazy eyes
Mama say if I'll be alright
Ooh ooh ooh
Take a look at my crazy eyes
Mama say if I'll be alright
Hey hey hey

And leave me out of everything they do
It's alright if the sun don't shine
It's impossible to darken my day
Makes no difference if I don't have a dime
I'll be wealthy anyway
Mmm, I'm no good without you
But listen baby, as long as I got you
Hey, look at lucky me, hey, ooh baby
In my life, there's no misfortune
No struggle or strife today
You're my lucky charm, my guiding star
So just smile and chase them blues away
I can't help it baby, you're so wonderful
Oh, how lucky can a-one man be
Oh, your tenderness and sweet caress
And it all belongs to me
I wanna tell the world about it
I wanna stand right up and shout it
Hey, look at lucky me"
1139,"Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain
It injures me, babe....
Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger, can make you sick, children... oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
Rage, there's no room for rage in there
There's no room for rage in here
Line up some place to go to be mad
It's a sin to treat your body bad
When anger really gets the best of us
We've really lost our heads
We often say a lot of things, oh darlin'
Wish we'd never said
Oh, reason is beyond control
And the things we do for spite
Makes me ashamed
And I mean this, baby, makes me want to the things right
Someday soon I hope and pray like Jesus
I'll reach that wiser age
Hope I will learn I really never never profit
From things I do in rage
One more time-anger, oh anger
When it's flaming hot
Anger burns to the bitter end
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
When it cools I find out too late
I have lost at love, love, love, dear friend
I said, anger will make you sick
Children, oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
I ain't gonna let you get the best of me, babe
I'm gonna go somewhere and cool
This is not the way my head's supposed to be, babe
You've got me feelin' like some silly fool
But I know a real nice place where I can go
And feel the way I'm supposed to feel
I don't want to be mad at nobody
I don't want to be feelin' bad
Up and down my back, my spine, in my brain
It injures me, babe
Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger will make you sick, children, oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
Anger
Anger"

My love is waiting for you"
1141,"Oh, if you want to do it, let's get it on
But how you going to act this time around?
Before we take it off down to the skin
Let's get an understanding
Girl you didn't understand my philosophy
You did not understand
You just ran away from me
Oh I miss you baby
Oh I miss you baby, oh I miss you
You're the best I ever had
You're so bad baby, but I must like you like that
Although you won't let me control this or that
I still find you're where it's at
Ah, now I see you're coming straight to the point
You say the more you get baby, ah, the more you want me
Yeah darling you're not wasting my time
What I see baby is so hard to find
Although you've been all over town baby
Having your affairs I still have to accept you back
Angel though you're promiscuous, I don't mind a bit
Because you're still the greatest lay, even when you're miles away


Girl if you run away again
Surely my heart would never mend
Don't tell me the love we made
Was just for old times sake
Staying up waiting for you to come home at night
Was just so hard to take
She said that pain might never mend
So let's be sometime lovers
Oh, baby that's when my poor heart broke up


Well if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
If you got a pretty girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
And if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life"
1142,"Flying high in the friendly sky
Without leaving the ground
The rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits
And it's bound to forsake me


So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I can't find it
In the morning I'll be alright my friends
Soon the night will bring the pains again


Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
That does seen nothing but trouble baby
Paraphernalia is my name
There's a place where the feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hands


I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy who makes slaves out of men

 

Ahh yeah - 

Ahh yeah - 

Nobody, nobody - 

Goodnight, darling - 

Take me away, take me away tonight - 

I'm so... - 

Nobody -

1143,"How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you


I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
And there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotion


I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby


How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you


I close my eyes at night
Wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby


How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you


You were better to me than I've been to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else


I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby

Wasn't you
You are everything
And everything is you
Oh, you are everything
And everything is you
'Cause you are everything
And everything is you
How can I forget
When each face that I see
Brings back memories
Of being with you
I just can't go on
Living life as I do

Knowing they just won't do
They're not you
'Cause you are everything
And everything is you

Fooling around with my mind instead of my heart
I was young and fine and you plucked me clean

But really, I was a dumb little fool
You said you'd never, never go away
And stay beside me night and day
You said you would love and obey
Well you should, well you should
It can only get you good
I was a dumb little fool
I was a dumb little fool
But I'll never get enough get enough
Enough of that funky stuff
I'm gonna jump back in
Up to my neck again
You always knew that I
Wasn't that kind of guy

Whether or not you’ve been lying?
Think about the mistakes you make
I believe, sir, that humanity’s at stake
You see, busin’, busin’ is just one issue, one issue
What about the rest of it, mister?


Well, if you've got the plan
I said, you, if you’ve got the master plan
I got to vote for you, ah yeah
I got to vote for you
‘Cause you’re the man, I know, ah yeah


Maybe what this country needs is a lady for president
No, we don’t wanna hear no more lies
About how you plan to economize
We want our dollar value increased
And employment to rise
This heavy taxation has got us all in this awful situation
Now, don’t, don't give us no peace sign
Turn around and rob the people blind
Oh, economics, money is all you’re interested in
Do you have a plan that all the people can share in?

Why not hear what they have to say?
Because the tables might turn against you
Set around Election Day

Will you, will you stop the bombs
And right all the wrongs this administration has done?
I know peace and freedom is the issue, oh Lord

What about the young folks?
What about marijuana?
What about peace, peace in the land?

Is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?

To see her treat me so unkind
Somebody, somewhere tell her it's unfair


Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Somebody


Is it right to be treated so bad
When you've given everything you had?
Even tossing in my sleep
Because I haven't seen my baby all week


Now, you chicks do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear, let me hear you say yeah, yeah


Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been crying
But I believe a woman's a man's best friend
So I'm going to stick by her until the very end

Love is supposed to be
Somebody, somewhere, tell her it ain't fair


Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?

 One can have a dream, baby

 Two can make that dream so real

 One can talk about being in love

 Two can say how it really feels

 One can wish upon a star

 Two can make that wish come true, yeah

 One can stand alone in the dark

 Two can make the light shine through


It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you, just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two



 One can have a broken heart, living in misery

 Two can really ease the pain like a perfect remedy

 One can be alone in a car, on a night like these all alone

 Two can make just any place seem just like being at home


Just takes two, just takes two



 One can go out to a movie, looking for a special treat

 Two can make that single movie something really kind of sweet

 One can take a walk in the moonlight, thinking that it's really nice

 But two walking hand-in-hand is like adding just a pinch of spice

I'm strong enough to last
You, you and your music
Are more precious than gold baby

Before you play the last side
Are you fit enough to ride
I said yes, baby

 all of the folks in jail need love

 even a mean old man needs love
Why can't you understand that I need love?"

1160,"By the look in your eye
I can tell you're going to cry
Is it over me?
If it is
Save your tears for I'm not worth it, you see


For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat
That's my home
I'm telling you that's my home


You had romance
Did you break it by chance over me?
If it's so
I'd like for you to know that I'm not worth it, you see


For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam
Mhm, wherever I lay my hat
That's my home
Mhm, that's my home


Oh, you keep telling me
You keep telling me I'm your man
What do I have to do to make you understand?
For I'm the type of guy who gives girl the eye
Everybody knows
But I love them and I leave them
Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go


Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam?
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
Wherever I lay my hat
Oh oh, that's my home
Mhm, yeah
That's my home and I like it that way"
1161,"I'd give anything to see
A little Christmas tree
And to hear, hear the laughter
Of children playing in the snow
To kiss my baby, under the mistletoe

Cause I'm a prisoner of war
Lying here in my cell
Hoping my family is well
Wish they wouldn't worry so much about me
Just try to get us home
In time for the Christmas tree
Listen, oh yeah, ooo
I want to see snowflakes fall
I want to see Santa Claus
Ooo, I want to hear jingle bells ring
Want to hear jingle bells ringing
But I can't promise my eyes this sight
Unless they stop the fight
Ooo, ooo, ooo
If I can't make it home in time
I know you'll be keeping my spirit bright
By wearing my name and trying to stop this fight
Ah, but I'd give anything to see you the family
And that little Christmas tree

 Till I'm old and gray

 Till my heart stands still, oh Tammi

 Oh Marvin, tell me why do you love me?



 I was just a rolling stone going nowhere
Empty like a hollow room filled with despair
Then, like a rainbow and a pot of gold
You came into my life and you saved my very soul





 I was so alone like a leaf without a tree
When out of the darkness your love lifted me
And I'm so grateful, baby I'm so glad
'Cause your sweet sweet love is the best I've ever had

So tonight, when the night time comes
I'll be getting some
Having fun"
1166,"I remember like it was yesterday
We were over Gwen's
And we was trying one more time to make amends
Oh yes we was
Suddenly it occured to me it did not matter
Whether I was mad at her
Or she was mad at me
Naw, babe
Understanding my condition
I must surely be a wishing
And a hoping to be free
Some say, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Yeah, she said, you can leave, but it's gonna cost you dearly, oh
You can leave, but it's going to cost you, hah, dearly
Sometimes your eyes was red as fire
Intoxicated
Sometimes your spirit was moving on me
It wanted to fight me
I had to fight to defend my life
I didn't mind it
You see, I find it
A bit stimulating
But after fighting
We're making love
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Cause after all, you was my wife
Hey, can you still boogie
Boogie down the road sometime
Hey, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
You were trying to put me down
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
I used to sing this song, I'm dancin' on
She said, you can leave, but it's going to cost you
Mystery man, what's going down
That young girl is going to cost you
If you want happiness, you got to pay
Oooh baby, used to be the apple of my eye
How come you loved me, baby?
How come you loved me
You used to be my heart's desire
My heart's desire, yeah
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
I'm gone, get used to it, baby
I'm gone, get used to it
You tried to have them shackle me
Bring me in
Tell me what for
So I'd satisfy you baby
You have won the battle
Oh but Daddy's gonna win the war
Her lawyers worked so hard
Tryin'a take my riches
Rich things, too
Trying to sell my home
Tried to take my life
Not my child too
Tryina upset my woman
Examinin' my soul
But I was strong, baby
Stood my ground and prayed
Asked the Lord to help
Wish he was in a position
To upset the judge
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You can leave, but it's going to cost you
You use to say that I was a gorgeous hunk of man
That didn't help me baby
Ah, when you was on the stand"
1167,"Oh you, you I see in my mirror in the morning
Instead of seeing me I see you, I see your face


And inside me is a growing need for your embrace
In the light of day, though our faces meet
Someone there might see, so we never speak
Till the dark of night, while the moon is new
When we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous
Though it's wrong I know, girl I love you so
Yes I need you, I need you baby 



Oh you, my sweetest joy
You can afford the best of life
I'm just a hard-working boy
Oh you've given your love to me 

Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me
We're worlds apart, so close yet worlds apart
So we must hide the love we're feeling in our hearts
We meet in shadows 

Your friends must never know 

That we are lovers, darling 

Although it hurts me so 

For your sake no one must see
The precious of love you're giving me
But you know, I need you baby 







Oh, one day I'll make the grade, my lucky star will shine
I will tell the world that you are mine, all mine
Till then we must go 

The way we have before 

And never let it show 

We love each other so 

Our love's a one-way track because there's no turning back
Oh I need you baby




You, you I see in my mirror in the morning 

Instead of seeing me 

I see you, I see your face 
"
1168,"Why did I choose you? What did I see in you?
I saw a heart you hide so well
I saw a quiet girl, who had a gentle way
Cute little way that caught me in its glowing spell


Why did I want you? What could you offer me?
Just a love to last my lifetime through?
And when I lost my heart so many years ago
I lost it lovingly and willingly, oh girl, to you


If I had to choose again, I would still choose you"
1169,"This is Anna's song
Ah, making love all night long
Take a bath in milk, and lay on your satin sheets
Laugh and smile andLay a while and

Chocolate mint, candy sweets




This is Anna's song


Keep on singing 

All night long 

Oooh work so hard, see me make a dollar


I know I should for my own good
""What's it, husband, makes you so stubborn?""
And oh
Didn't you notice the snow, starting to fall
Come let us sit a while, just listen
To the children laughing and running wild
Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
Yeah this is Anna's song - hey baby
Hey baby, loving you all night long
Let it happen again and again and again baby and again
She's a child of the sun, lovingest one of all
Mmm and this is Anna's song yeah
Keep on loving me baby loving me 'cross the hall
She can't do no wrong 'cause this is Anna's song
Laugh and shed a tear, kiss me, Anna dear
Ooohhhh baby

The one that i promise baby, promise you all along

Never have a fear, here it is, my dear"

And then a kiss but more than this

And in July, lemonade
To cool you in some leafy place
I wish you health and more than wealth
I wish you love
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love
Well, my breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never, never be
So with my best, my very best
I set you free
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all, when snowflakes fall
I wish you love, love, love"

And make it alright make it alright

All I wanna feel

Your arms holding me
All I wanna know
Are you still there

And not to cry
Just say you haven't lost the feeling

Suddenly a stranger entered my life
Like I pictured her to be
Started my emotions running free
Oh, just like the waters in the sea


As she looked at me with a smile so sincere
My heart started to sing in a voice, I'm sure she could hear
I reached out for a tender loving kiss
Only to find my love didn't even exist, oh baby
I then realized it was just a dream
The candlelight's burning such a radiant beam
Oh how I yearned for this dream to come true
For just one exciting moment with someone like you
But as I sat there with tears falling from my eyes
I seemed to dream a thousand and one sighs
Yeah, hope was passing by with a slow unhappy pace
And all there was for me was the bitterest taste, oh baby
Stranger in my life, surely it was
Stranger in my life, oh baby


But as I sat there, tears falling from my eyes
The stranger in my life reached out
Honey, reached out for me
And opened my world of loneliness with a magical kiss, oh baby
Stranger in my life, tell you she's so fine
Stranger in my life, she's wonderful
Stranger in my life, telling you she's fine
Stranger in my life, I know she's wonderful"

Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah


I try to put my arms around you
All because I want to hold you tight


But every time I reach for you, baby
And try to kiss you, you're just jumping out of sight


Oh, I've got news for you
Baby, that I've made plans for two
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you


Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah
Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah


I'm going to love you


In every way


I'm going to love you


In every way




With other girls I've wanted
I've made it just a moment
With you I'll share each day


Now I know you've heard about me
Bad things about me, baby, please let me explain


Oh, I have kissed a few
I tell you, a few have kissed me too
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow
Got my mind made up to love you


Ah say yeah yeah yeah, say yeah yeah yeah"
1183,"Get your ass in gear
Come closer here
See your passion sweat
Now is it wet?
I'll jam you 'til you faint
You're no saint
I'll rock you 'til your sore
Like a whore
Forget that closet scene
I'm so mean
I'll throw you on the floor
Like before
You say it's not your thing
But still you come
You say you hate my guts
Still want some
You silly little freak
Tryin' to rise
The devil's strong in you
It's in your eyes
The thing that's deep in you
You can't resist
I'm gonna tie you up and have my wish
You do not understand but still you love
The way you worship it is all your thinking of
Everybody knows the thing you love
While you're on your knees
Raise your dress above..
Get down...
...Shut up
You nasty little slave, kiss my feet
Put your face right here and start to eat
Get down...
Shut up...
Get down...
Get up!
If you do it right, you get the pipe
And if you do it wrong, I'll spank you long
I love you, my masochistic beauty
I love you, I love your booty
I love it, my masochistic beauty... Yes
I love you, I love your booty
And it's my duty to spank your booty
And it my duty to spank your booty


It's my duty
To spank your booty


I love you
Got to learn
Shutup!
Get down
Get up
Get down
Get up
I know about your thing
You hate yourself
You selfish little bitch
You're in poor health
I'll use you till you moan
And cry so hard
Your guilt becomes your key
To turn to God
Although I am a part of this
Like you
I am a master man
With work to do
You must obey my will
Or face my rod
'Cause if you can't for me
You can't for God
Get down
Get up!
Get down
Get up!
Bitch, are you coming?
Get down
Deception is your game
You've been had
All your men are glad
And you are sad
Most of them were rich
But you are poor
Yet you take their cum
For nothing more
Seems that you're delighted
To fuck fate
You're looking for a way
To close the gate
The things you know you
Should you never do
Despite all the pain
It takes you through
My masochistic beauty"
1184,"I met a little girl, sure was fine
Pretty little thing just about blew my mind
She took me home, and made love to me
I knew right then and there this is where I wanted to be
Most of my life I had been all, all alone
And you're so sweet to me, don't think I'll ever roam
And then one day as time will pass
I had this feeling that our love would last
Nothing could go wrong and it seemed everything I did
Seemed to please you; all the heartaches you hid
Then one night after we made it, and we were through
That's when I decided I wanted to marry you
Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife
To love, hold, and cherish for the rest of your life?
I do, yes I do, I do darlin'
Cause I love you
1964
Once you really loved me
Once I really loved you
1976
Then time would change you
As time would really change me
We thought our love would stand the test of time
And as I sing this song right now I wonder today
If you're a friend of mine
Cry cry cry-I have done some crying
Woman, you have caused my tears to flow
Cry cry cry-d you cry about me?
Do you think about the kind of love we had?
Hal-le, hallelejah
Hal-lelu, I'm free
Hal-le, hallelejah
Hal-lelu, I'm free"
1185,"Dreams of you, dreams of you
Are so fine, so fine, baby
Since I woke up
So is my state of mind
Since we've been apart, baby
God has healed my heart
Used to go out looking for love
Now love is looking for me
And sweet music keeps me happy
Not so long ago, darling, I was feeling sad
Who would've kissed my lips
I would've still felt bad, ah baby
There were times I've wondered if I was insane
Ah baby, I simply let my tear drop fall like rain
Oh baby, but when I kiss your lips
The clouds begin to roll away
Uh, down to my finger tips
I feel the happiness each day
Oh, my Mama said to me
She told me, son love goes where you take it
So, stay with the spirit, boy
I feel that you gonna make it, yeah
Got me wondering, yeah
'Cause music's been my therapy
Taking the pain from all my anatomy
Music has never let me down
It's my symphony, always stayin' in me
Who'd know that the world ain't right, ah baby
Lots of people uptight
I'll go crazy if something ever happened to my musical thrill
And darling your love is just like music
Music is the soul of the man
Music makes a happy day
Music makes the clouds roll by, baby
Your music kissed my tears and set my eyes
Your music makes me want to sing
Your music is a joy to bring
Music is my heart and soul
It's more precious than gold
You're like a song in my heart
I love every part
A song, you're like a song
Happiness today is just a song away, just a song
I love your music, baby
I don't worry 'bout a thing
Oh, turn on your music, baby
See my happiness beam
Your love is music
Oh my darling, yeah
Your love is music, ah baby, yeah
And music is my life
Turn on some music more
Hey, turn on some music more
I got my music, hey, hey
I love my music, hey
We need the music
I got my music, hey
I love the music, oh
Turn on some music
Get off the music, ah
Turn up the music
Let's have the music, ha"

On the window tops and the mountain

On the beaches sand
Comes a man with a plan to renew the world
Up in Rasta land, hungry boys and girls
He lived up to his part
And he died with a cause in his heart

Satisfied, you got what it takes to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
You got what it takes for me



You don't live in a beautiful place
You don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby you got what it takes to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
You've got what it takes for me

My head goes around and round
And when you kiss me
My love comes tumbling down
You send me

1188,"Ooh, walking in the rain is insane, can't explain
How I feel when I'm walking in the rain with you
It rains in my hair but I don't seem to care
Just as long as you're walking with me, too


It rains as we walk
We get sunny weather
We stop and we talk
Then we get wet together
Rain from the sky
Would be rain from my eyes

Should you ever go


Oh, now rain from the sky
Would be rain from my eyes

Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love all over
I'm falling in love again
I, I found somebody who says she love me
I'm falling in love again, falling in love again, falling in love
Once again... Hey baby
She's pretty, outside and in...

But what to do, baby
What could I do
When somebody real comes in
Someone who feel comes in
Now I'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
I found somebody
She says she love me
I'm falling in love again
Oh, beautiful woman
Falling in love again

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost

Do you know how lost I've been
At the thought of reminiscing
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

What's the matter with you, baby, what's the matter?
What did I do wrong?
Do you really want to know?
I want to know, what's the matter with you, baby?
You know that you done me wrong
Sorry, didn't mean no harm
Oh baby, let me take you out tonight
Make every little thing all right
You know you told me there would never be another
And you know you lied
When you lied, you hurt me, baby
When I left and I went away
I didn't know how much I loved you until today
Oh baby, leaving me wasn't right
And now you want to take me out tonight
Mary, won't you let me get on your good side?
If I did that, Marvin, it would hurt my pride
Hey, let me make it up to you if I can
I can't do it, don't you understand?
What's the matter with you, baby, what's the matter?
I told you that you done me wrong
Well, can you forgive me, Mary, please forgive me?
I'll try, but it'll take some time
Hurry up, hurry up, before I lose my mind
I've got a feeling everything is going to work all right
But you can't take me out tonight


Whoa, whoa, whoa"
1193,"Marvin:
My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world
First I had you
In the palm of my hand
But I let you slip through
Like grains of sand
At the beginning
When I didn't care
Like my own reflection
You were always there
My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world
Diana:
You were sweeter
Then my very own skin
But what did I do for you
Not a thing
In front of my friends
You broke me down
Since then darling
It's hard to track you down
My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world
Marvin:
Many a smile
You put on my face
But I paid dearly
With the tears I taste
Diana:
My tenderness
Made you cold, not sweet
'Cause if a girl loves you
You only call her weak
My mistake was to love you, boy
Love you, boy
My mistake was to give my all
Tell the world
Marvin:
My mistake was to love you, girl
Love you, girl
My mistake was to give you all
Tell the world"

Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me

Lift your heart up and save your life

You've fallen down so far
How could someone mislead you at all?

 My loving heart would shake
More than the earth could break
If you should ever go
You know my heart would break

 If I lost your sweet embrace
Even time could not erase
The memories of you
Tears would cover up my face



 Oh how I'd miss you, baby

 I need you so

 Oh how I'd miss you

 Baby never go

 I'll never leave



 My world would cease to be
Without the love you give to me
The chains around my heart
Would never set me free

 When my life had just begun
My sky didn't have a sun
You fill my every need
So if you ever leave





 Oh you're always on my mind
Losing you would leave me blind
Fill my heart forevermore
Never leave my love behind

 With the joy your love can bring
To you I'll always cling
If you took away your love
It would be the end of things

1196,"I was so proud of myself
As a lover before you came
I never begged no girl to love her
Out of the eight million people in the city

You make me do things I don't wanna do
You make me do things I don't wanna do
Oh, baby, honey, honey
I'm trying hard to keep
The upperhand
But now I losing
My ground as a man
Today the sharpest looking girl came around
For the first time in my life, I turned one down
I love this girl and I was on to the next one
But I can't find no one that loves, you're the best one
You make me do things I don't wanna do
You make me do things I don't wanna do
Oh, wrapped around your finger, baby
That's right darling
I fight myself
But I fight a losing battle
I try to tell my foolish self
It don't matter
You're number one as a lover
I'm number two
I try harder to recover
You make me do things I don't wanna do
You make me do things I don't wanna do
I don't want
Do things I don't want to do
But you make me
Yes, you do

Walking in my shoes
Walking to the beat
Still got some love inside
And some good old body heat

Only here to deepen my soul
No it ain't about money

Won't fulfil the need

Want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
I want you to sing, little sparrow, sing
A pretty bird song
Sing to me, let me hear your agony

Sing to me of peace and love
Sing to me of God above
Sing sparrow, oh sparrow, sing
Sing to me about man's inhumanity
And all the injustice you see
Sing sparrow, sing, little sparrow, sing
Sing about what to give
Sing about about how to live
I want you to sing your tune sparrow

Aww, sing at me
Sing me a, sing me a song
I wanna know what's wrong, little bird, tell me
Aww, sparrow
Sing sparrow 'cause I wanna know

1205,"The shadow of your, of your smile
When you are gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn
Look into my eyes, oh my love, and you'll see for sure
Ah baby, all the wonderful things you are to me
Darling, a wistful little star was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
Darling, so did I


Oh, now when I remember spring
And all the joys that love can bring
I'll be remembering
The shadow of your smile"
1206,"There's gonna be times, I know, girl
When the going's gonna get a little rough, child
There's gonna be times, I know, girl
When the going's gonna get a little tough


Oh, but if you and me, oh baby, got unity
Hey, girl, me for you and you for me
Just as long as we got that kind of love
We can make it, baby
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar
Just as long as we got that kind of love
We can make it, baby


Oh, there's gonna be times, I know, girl
When you might wanna just sit right down and cry
Hey, hey, hey, hey
But don't you let that bother you, girl
'Cause when you need me, girl
I'm gonna be standing right by your side


'Cause we got love, so much love
Oh, we can make it, baby

That all our friends admire
The kind I like to boast about
The kind that I can't live without


Nothing's always gonna be like a distant dream
I'll be your realest friend when you need me, girl
So come on, girl, let's take the world
Come on now, let's do it, let's do it, woo

1207,"Hey, hey, hey
There is a joy in a sweet word that's been spoken
And the joy in a dream that's come true
There's a joy that I get when I'm watching you baby
And the joy that I get watching the skies of blue
And then there's a joy, oh my darling, of a crying baby
And the joy of a child that's born to you
Then there's a joy of a beautiful lady
And the joy of the morning dew


It's something like the joy of loving you baby, joy of dancing too
It's something like the joy of loving you baby, joy of being with you


Oh my darling, I'll overcome the darkest nights
Just to see your love's alright
I've got a love to give
You know I love to live
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby
Damn, Good God"
1208,"Oh, I used to ask my mother
Would I ever find true love?
She would tell me
True love
 
 
is hard to find

 
Mmm-hmm
So I traveled on
Everyone I came upon
I would stop and ask
They would tell me
True love is hard to find, mmm-hmm
That's what they would say
The years that passed
I'm all alone
No longer do I ask
I just place my faith
In five little words
From way back in my past
My mama said


Seek and you shall find
That's what mama said
Seek and you shall find


Sometimes I get so lonely 

It seems useless to go on
But then I remember
Somewhere true love is waiting there
But I'll keep on holding on 

But I'll keep on keeping on 

But I know that I keep trying
I can't lose 'cause there's no denying


Seek and you shall find
That's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Help me somebody!
Oooh
Oooh
Oh


Now there is no happy ending
To this story I'm telling you
But I remember somewhere
True love, I know it's waiting there
I'm going to keep on keeping on
You know that I'm going to keep holding on
Because I now if I keep trying
I can't lose 'cause there's no denying


Seek and you shall find
I know that's what my mama said
Seek and you shall find
Oh, oh
Seek and you shall find
Is it love that you're looking for?
Seek, oh, and you shall find
It might be right around the corner
Seek..."
1209,"This is the story of two lovers who shouldn't have been
They did their thing and went their separate ways again
Then by chance they met at the neighborhood dance
And got that old feeling all over again
He said, ""How much have you missed me since I had you?""


How much. 

How much. 

Ooh I really wondered, girl
Wondered if you remember baby
How could say wait to me darling
Such a thrill, but it's been so hard since I had you baby
Ah sugar, come on give me a break
Because it's been so hard since I had you baby


My eyes must look serious
Because when I look at you I get delirious
Your voice sounds so serious
But since we're still friends
Let me make love to you again, baby


Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had your sugar
Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had you baby


Big Daddy Rucker is show nuff playing
Ahhh, this is a mellow dance
Oh, baby its been such a long time
Remember when I used to do this to you?
Come on, let this be the last dance


Since I had you girl I have wanted no other lover
Since I had you honey there hasn't been no other woman
Since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman
Since I taste you loving I haven't seen no other woman
Since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman
You might believe it but since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman"

Why should I feel
So discouraged

Oh yeah
Since Jesus, since Jesus
Since Jesus is my potion

1211,"Oh, yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now, I need a place to hide away
Oh, I, I believe in yesterday


Suddenly
People, I ain't half the man I used to be, no
There's a heavy, heavy shadow hanging over me
Yesterday, came all too suddenly
Oh, why did she have to go?
I don't know
Tell you, I don't know
The little girl wouldn't say


I must have, must have said something wrong
Now I long, long, long for yesterday


Oh, talking about yesterday
Love, love, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Lord I, I believe now, in yesterday, oh

1217,"
 There's a spark inside my heart
That sets my soul on fire & keeps the flame inside me
I love it, Marvin

 Baby, just like the glow from out the night
When you're near, I feel all right
Something inside me keeps me yearning, oo baby



 I'll never stop loving you baby, no no no no

 I'll never stop loving you, Marvin, no no no no



 Near to you, I'm sure I'll rhyme
Every dream that's passed through my mind
Simply because your love makes me believe

 Near to you, I feel so strong
& I know I can right any wrong
Loving you gives me the power that I always need





 Baby, tell me baby

 Oh baby, right from the start, you showed you cared
Every moment that we ever shared
Has brought me one step closer, oh to you

 That one day, honey, since we met
Have you surely one reason to regret?
Giving my love to you, dear

Thoughts of you running through my head mean you're a part of me

Marvin: What I want to say is
Diana: All I want to say is
Both: That I love you ‘cause you're that very special part of me
Marvin: Oh oh baby
Diana: Anytime you look into my eyes Can't you see what you mean to me 

And every time you hear me speak your name 

Can't you tell what you mean to me 

Both: Wohoh hey, you can't move the moon, you can't stop the passing time
Ain't it plain by now you can't move this love of mine

1220,"Girl, before you walk away
Here's one thing I've got to say
I'll be no good without you, baby
No good without you, baby


Well, I've got money, and I've got fame
But if you leave me, it don't mean a thing
That's why I'm begging, baby, please don't go
That's why I'm trying, love, to let you know
That's why I'm trying, baby, to make you see
Just how much, how much you mean to me


I'll be no good without you, baby
No good without you, baby


Your love, it made me ten feet tall
Your leaving leaves me nothing at all
What did I do, baby, to make you wanna go?
What did I say, baby, to hurt you so?
What's come between us? Can it be
Somebody has stole your love from me?
Oh, oh, oh baby
Baby, please, please don't leave me
If you leave me, baby, I'll be in misery


No good without you, baby
I'll be no good without you, baby


Well, take my money, and take my fame
'Cause if you leave me they don't mean a thing
Oh, I'll keep on begging, baby, please don't go
And I'll love you harder than I did before
'Cause I'll be crying when you close the door
'Cause I know, I know when you go


I'll be no good without you, baby
Baby, don't leave me
I'll be no good without you, baby
Oh, don't leave me, baby, baby

Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart


Cause I sacrifice to make you happy
Get nothing for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I believe, baby, you'd better keep on keeping on


Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart


My biggest mistake was loving you too much
And letting you know
Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you're gonna let me go
My heart was made glad when you strolled, you see
Heartaches and misery you've been causing me


Baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't you break my heart=


Go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see by me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?
Open up your heart; can't you see I need you?
I'm no good without you, can't go on without you
Life's no good without you, what'm I gonna do without you?
Baby don't do it, don't you break my heart
Don't you do it, baby, don't you break my heart
What'm I gonna do without you?
Got to go on, baby
Baby don't you do it"
1222,"Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine


I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love


Your words don't mean what they used to me
They were once inspired, now they're just routine


I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love


I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look the same
You're a lot the same
But my heart says ""No, no, you're not the same""


I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
So is love, the masquerade is over
So is love"

What the world needs now
Is a little more love
Little more love
Little more love
Just a little more love


Can't be no love
When there's nothing but pain inside
Can't see no love
When you're looking through too much pride
Oh, peace, love, understanding
In the eye of the beholder
People are staying home
When they got chips on their shoulder
We must all work together
We must help one another


Oh, people
Try it, you'll like it
What the world needs now's
Just a little more love
Little more love


You better watch that man
Standing there pointing the finger
Just like a bee, getting ready to sting ya
Health, wealth and freedom

How you gon' get it together
With chains around your mind?
We must all work together
Lord have mercy
We must all love one another

Well, whatcha gon' do?
True to life as a mirror
And the reflection is you, you, you, you, you, you

Really couldn't get away too soon


I can't imagine anything that's better

Don't you know we doing anything we like to do
There's always lots of things that we can see
You can pick anyone we like to be
With all those happy people we could meet
Just setting the groove


Grooving on a Sunday afternoon
Really couldn't get away too soon


Groove with me baby

How far is the journey from here to a star?


And if I left you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean? how high is the sky?"
1226,"Right around the corner there is an angel, yeah
And all I hope and pray, I'll make her my girl
So, if I have wings of gold, I'd fly to you, my love
Yes, I would
And on my way to you I'll catch a star from above


Straight away I'll fly to cloud number nine
See if my baby was feeling fine
When I get there, this is what I'd say


Hello there, angel, are you feeling fine today?
I happen to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd fly by your way, to say
Angel love, my darling angel, can you come out to play?
Come on angel, please, I love you


Now right around the corner there is an angel
If Phyllis only knew, oh how she ran into you
Yes, she would!


The beauty of your love shines trough and trough
And all, all without you
I know my world will come to an end
But I feel you float beside me
With each day, a new dawn begins


Hello there, angel, are you feeling fine today?
I happen to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd fly by your way, to say
Angel love, my darling angel, can you come out to play?
Come on angel, please
Oh. walkin' with your halo on
Hello angel, yes darling, I want to take you home"
1227,"It was a sad wedding, a very sad wedding
And the tears came tumbling from my eyes


We fell in love, first day we met
Then later on we were wed
And as we stood there greeting all our friends
Here's what I heard somebody say


It was a sad wedding, oh, how I cried
Oh, how beautiful was the bride




I was so nervous, I just couldn't wait
To see you walk down the aisle
Then suddenly there was music, all my fear was gone
And you came walking with a smile
We had our reception
Then we were on our way
Off to our honeymoon
When you threw your bouquet
And rice flew over our heads
I overheard somebody say

Yeah, we need you
And everybody who loves truth

And make a mountain of happy souls, oh oh

Your touch, I don't love you too much


Now that you are standing here, darling, I won't shed a tear
This is just the rain in my eyes
And if I have proved to you that everything I say is true
Please help me believe my own lies


Girl, it's funny how I've stopped loving you
And it's funny I don't miss all of the heaven in your kiss
Your touch, I don't love you, not too much, baby, not too much
Oh, you went away and left me, baby
I don't love you, too much
Just with all my heart, dear"
1232,"My Funny Valentine
Sweet comic valentine -
You make me smile, with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Un-photagraphable
Yet you're my favorite work of art


Is your figure, less than greek
Is your mouth, a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?


But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me -
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each Day is Valentine's Day




Don't baby don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me -
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each Day is Valentine's Day"

I was walking on rainbows
Like nobody else has done
This will make you laugh
But darling I staked my dream on you, aww baby
This will make you laugh
They never did come true, they never did come true
I took a chance on young romance
And vowed it would not miss
But i never, never, never should have judged
A heart by a kiss
This is gonna make you laugh
But baby, i believed in you
For all my love, darling, you didn't see it through, boo-hoo
For all the fools, I break the rules

Now I don't know for sure but I think you'd like it too
Cause, oh little baby, you're what's happening in the world today

Hey hey oh, it's such a special special treat

 Each moment breathlessly sweet



 That's the way it is when we're together
Yeah yeah yeah yeah



 Even when we casually roam

 Oh baby, down by the countryside & back home
It seems to make up for the time we spend alone

 Oh Marvin, when I talk with you
I'm looking forward to

 When we're together

 Baby, when we're

 together

It's a mystery
Feeling the pain
And I feel the love
And once again
You're the world to me

What are these strange emotions
Loving the pleasure sweetly
Loving the pain as deeply
It's almost midnight
And my love is coming down
Lots of ladies love me
But it's still a lonesome town
(Very special love
Very special love affair)
(Very special love
Very special love affair)
You've got me looking for love
Though you're my sole desire
Looking for love and a girl for me
You've got me looking for love
And my soul's on fire
Looking for love and a girl for me
Memories of our love obsesses me
Thoughts of us are sending all the time
If I gave into your soul, my dear
Then you really never could be mine
Very, very loving day
Think of you every day, think of you all kinds of ways
Sometimes I hate your guts
And love your lust
Sometimes I love your guts
And hate your lust
It was a crazy love affair
A crazy love affair
Oh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Sometimes I hate your lust

Only, only on the telephone
When I call
Talking about the kid
Talking about the baby
Talking about the baby

Life is a game
People think life is a game
They think life is a game, baby
Ain't it strange? It ain't never the same
Gonna turn around, baby
Turn it around, soon
Gonna be getting down
Got to turn around, going to turn it around

I'm going home
To see what I saw in the past
I'm going home
Where somebody love me

I began to roam
Never should have left home
Thought I was grown
But now I see what it meant to me

1243,"Oh, oh my darling
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
The artist pays the price
So you won't have to pay
If only we would listen
To what they have to say
There are songs from wisdom
There are songs from satan
There are songs from lovin'
And there are songs from hatin'
There are songs from lust
And there are songs from pain
Some songs were done by chosen men
Some from men, insane
Groove, baby, groove on the light, one time
Groove, baby, on the right
Dance, baby, to the light this time
Dance sugar, on the right side
Groove, baby, groove on the light this time
Groove, baby, on the right side
Dance, baby, to the light, lookin' good
Dance, baby, to the light
Some songs will show which way to go
If only you would listen
Bad songs that turn you on
Show you how much is missing
Songs we're meant to listen to
You're checkin' out the best
Good songs were sent to men from God
Help us pass the test
Life is for learning
And the purpose is joinin' up
With the love of thousand bodies needed
But your soul is never destroyed
Your love, darling, this is all we desire
And all they want is a little understanding, yeah
Sometimes a song can prophesize a warning from the Master
To make your soul listen to, make your learnin' faster
The Devil have his special plan
To make hot songs for sinners
Thank God we'll turn it around
And make good songs for winners
Ay, did you know
Some songs can corrupt your flesh to dust
The only song you should live
Are songs that you can trust
The artist pays the price"
1244,"I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid like ""I love you""
I can see it in your eyes
That you still despise the same old lines
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you
For me it's true
It never seemed so right before
I practice everyday
To find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait
Until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right
Your perfume fills my head
The stars get red and oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying something stupid like ""I love you""
The time is right
Your perfume fills my head
The stars get red and oh, the night's so blue

By saying something stupid like ""I love you""
""I love you""
""I love you""
""I love you"""
1245,"Like a breath of spring you came
& as you leave, I can only sigh your name
Cries of anguish echo from way down
But will never reach my lips to make a sound
Though it seems my world is crumbling
Honey, you don't owe me anything because


What you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last


You've given me so much warmth
I don't see how I could ever grow cold
In my room there's a picture of you and I
That nobody has a price to buy
I don't know what made you change your mind
But you'll be back, it's just a matter of time


What you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last


Into my life you came like a breath of spring
Given me a song to sing
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
And though I know you're leaving
I won't be grieving 'cause I know
Time has a way of showing us
The things we really need
And no matter where you go
I know you'll find your way back home
Oh baby, though I know it's not reality
You'll always be a part of me
Because what you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last


I'm going to live once again
What you gave me
Is more than enough to last
I love you, I love you
Hey now, and what you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last"

I was lonely, so lonely
Once upon a time
Hoping every day things would go my way
Then you came into my life
Now everything is fine


I never knew what love could do until I met you
Now everything is oh, so cozy
Now my skies are blue all because of you
I'm so glad
I was lonely
Once upon a time
I never knew what love could do until I met you
Now everything is oh, so cozy
Now my skies are blue all because of you

Love is more precious than gold
I once made a decision in my life
A long, long, long time ago
I went for money instead of love
Now I'm so blue and it only goes to show
The things I once thought exciting
They've all grown tiresome and old
Here's a fool learned a lesson

Got to pray and meditate


On the birdies and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the fishes in the rivers
And on all the things He give us
On your body in His image
And your power with no limits
On your heart and your soul
And your purpose and your goals
On your reasons and your rhymes
And your seasons and your times
On your family and your Bible
And your knowledge of survival

Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving


Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
Cause lately I've been losing sleep




Empty nights echo your name
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah
When you see me smile, you know
Things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed
Darling, I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me, darling
Makes me feel half alive

Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far


The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Ah


Me throat she sick from necktie
Me feet she hurt from shoes
Me pocket full of empty
I got Calypso blues


Dese yankee girls give me big scare
Is black de root, is blonde de hair?
Her eyelash false, her face is paint
And pads are where de girl she ain't
She jitterbugs when she should waltz
I even think her name is false
But calypso girl is good a lot
Is what you see, is what she got


Sittin' by de ocean
Me heart, she feel so sad
Sittin' by de ocean
Me heart, she feel so sad...
I don't got de money
To take me back to Trinidad
I don't got de money
To take me back to Trinidad


Wa-o wa-o
Wa-o wa-o wa-o wa-e
Wa-o wa-o
Wa-o wa-o wa-o wa-e
Wa-o wa-o
Wa-o wa-o wa-o wa-e
Ah"
1257,"I could have left and said I told you so


I could have told the whole wide world and leave you sad and blue


Said I could have left and said it's good for you, yeah now
But I know when it hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too


I could have said that you had it coming to you


When you walked out and turned your back on me


I played it, baby, all along, please, please baby, don't go
'Cause I knew he would hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too


He said he had you dancing on a string
As far as love goes, you were just another fling
Oh, I may be a fool to love you the way I do


Don't you realize even fools have feeling too
So baby, come on back
And let me dry the tears from your eyes


'Cause I would never hurt you


No, no I'd never hurt you


'Cause baby when he hurt you
Don't you know it hurt me too




It hurts me so bad


I'd never desert you

"
1258,"Every day that passes by
I think about the new love you found
And my eyes cloud up and cry


Because I want you around
I want you around


I spend my saddest moments
After the sun goes down
That's when my heart starts aching


Because I want you around
I want you around


No matter where I travel
In the country or a town
My lips call out your name


Because I want you around
I want you around
Because I want you around
I want you around
Because I want you around
I want you around"
1259,"There's a train leaving here tomorrow
And I'll be a free man once again
I'm so glad I served my time
I'm going to meet the girl that I left behind


And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got


There were times
When each day seemed like a year
But the sweet things she said in the letters
Made the time just disappear
She said no other arms will I let hold me
Because in your arms is where I want to be


And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got


Baby, oh baby, my little darling
I'm coming home


The nights I've stared out my window at the moonlight
Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight
I must have been out of my mind to do the wrong I did
And leave her behind


And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got"
1260,"You think you're so way out
And you got all the action
Still you can't find no satisfaction
Baby - try me, and I'll make you see


You ain't living until you're loving, baby
You ain't living until you're loving, baby
Ooh, until you fall you ain't living at all
Ah ah, at all


You like to kiss and run
And that's where it is
Cause somebody told you
Love was heartaches and tears
Baby, although you're free
I'll make you see




To be in love, I know it's not your ambition
But before you go, think about my proposition
You may conquer the world and be king on a throne
But you still ain't nobody, baby
When you're sitting all alone


"
1261,"Now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Oh, you're doing just fine, fine, fine
But take away your good looks
And all your fancy clothes


Why don't you just
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby


You'll see
Nobody loves you but me


Now you tell me that you so busy, pretty baby
You ain't got much time
Oh, how will I remember
When all your time was mine, mine, mine
Well move on back cross the track, baby
Where you came from


Why don't you just
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby


You'll see
Nobody loves you but me


I really want to hold you, pretty baby
In my arms again
But I can't get close to you
For all your loving friend, friend, friend
But take your name from the bright lights baby
And tell me that you are all through
Come on and
Try it honey
Try it baby
Try it sweetheart
Try it honey
You'll see, nobody loves you but me"

So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me

I can't do without you, darling
Like a sea without a shore
Kicking forever more
Keep on loving me honey, don't you change your mind

 hold on (hold on
To your unchanging love
I'm going to hold on 
 hold on (hold on
To your unchanging love
I need you baby, baby I need you right now


Darling, there comes a time in everybody's life
They may learn as I've learned
That being loved is more important than painting the town
Only noon and night
Cause my life may have bright lights
But I've learned in time they go dim
But your love and tender arms, I can always come home to them




I used to have more friends than I could count
But now all of my so-called friends are gone
Cause I've lost everything in my bank account
Darling, I'm tired of running 'round
So in your arms I'm gonna settle down
Cause if I don't have a dime, I know your love is mine




Darling, everybody need somebody, o I need you
I know now, nobody really loves me, honey honey honey, the way you do
One more thing
I've changed, girl, through my life as often as I change my suits
Only to learn the only true happiness is being, honey, being loved by you
That's why

One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
Gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
And on that day, when I up and leave you
You can beat your life that I won't be back no more
Sang-a-song like duh dah duh dah
Duh dah duh dah duh dah duh duh dah duh


I know that I'm just a fool for you
Nobody has to tell me the way I am
It's the way I feel that make a difference
You see I love you so much that I don't care how I am


Hey now, what am I supposed to do
When you find out your love was untrue
Hey now, just have to stay
'Cause I don't have enough left to walk away


One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
Gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
Until that day, when I get my self together
I'm gonna stay right here, baby come with me"
1265,"Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft
And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do
Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo


When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your leading me to
It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your leading me to
It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch

There's no nicer witch than you"
1266,"There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
'Til there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
'Til there was you


Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew


There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
'Til there was you






'Til there was you"
1267,"Because of you there's a song in my heart
Because of you my romance had its start
Because of you the sun will shine
The moon and stars will say you're mine
Forever, and never to part



I only live for your love and your kiss
It's paradise to be near you like this
Because of you, my life is now worthwhile
And I can smile because of you"
1268,"I know I stand in line, until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two


And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid
Like: ""I love you


I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true
It never seemed so right before
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red
And oh the night's so blue

Good loving ain't easy
Good loving ain't easy to come by

Look what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey


Good loving ain't easy
Good loving ain't easy, darling
Good loving ain't easy to come by, oh no no
I've tried the good life and I know
It's a playground where no one cares
But at last you'll find out that don't compare
To what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey


It takes more than just a song and dance
You've got to work and fight to give it a chance
If the rain comes down on us
And there ain't no place to run
We'll just cover ourselves with a blanket of love
And wait till the morning comes
Oh baby, let's do it today
Inflection
Give us protection


Good loving ain't easy to come by
Some think it's a plaything
You can toss away when it's old
But when love's valued in pieces
It's worth more than gold

Good loving ain't easy to come by over
Oh, oh, it ain't easy"

That lingers in your ear
You can't forget
From sunrise to sunset

California soul


They say the sun
Comes up every morning
And if you listen carefully
The winds that ride
On the high tide
Whistle a melody
So the people started to sing
And that's how the
Surf gave birth untold to


California soul
California soul


When you hear the beat
You want to pat your feet
And you've gotta move cause
It's really such a groove
Puts a brand new kind of
Thinking in your mind
And you can't go wrong
Cause you're happy all day long


California soul
California soul


They had the melody and the beat
But it still didn't seem complete
Until they saw two lovers kissing
They knew just what was missing
So happy they were
Rocking and reeling
Because that added
That loving feeling

California soul


California soul
Now if they move you
Will it move you
It can groove, you, baby
California Soul now now now
California Soul, yeah

1271,"There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
And though he wandered very far
Very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he


And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""


""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return"""
1272,"Seems just yesterday you were in my arms
And in a special way you touched my heart with all your charms
And now you're gone
Oh and I find myself, honey, I'm all alone
And there's no love left to take
Don't know where I fell, for you I've always cared
I did all I know
To win your love and make it so


You'd always stay but you turned away
Honey, what could I say?
How could you, how could you
How could you do me this way?


Because I'm chained to your love and affection
Because I'm chained; oh your love's my only direction
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah


I've got to make it right, somehow it's always wrong
Somewhere down the line
The love I've lost I've got to find, yeah
But it won't be long
I'm going to make it right, baby
And carry you tenderly back home


Because I'm chained to your love and affection
Because I'm chained; every time I hear your name I tremble
I tremble, oh you know, oh you know


Oh baby, oh baby
Well, now I admit that I
Haven't been the perfect guy
For a girl as sweet as you
But my heart and soul cries, How do you?
Oh, that's all I need
Oh, going to make it right, baby
If you just stay, stay with me
Because I'm chained
Oh I'm chained to your love and affection
Yes I'm chained"
1273,"All you have to do is touch my hand
To show that you understand
And something happens to me that's some kind of wonderful


Every time my little world seems blue
I-I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful


I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There is so much I want to say but the right words won't come my way


I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful




I just know when I'm in your embrace
Lord!, this world is a happy place
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful


Some kind of a soft love
Some kind of a warm love
Some kind of wonderful
Some kind of wonderful, yes, it is, I-I-I know


Say I know"
1274,"I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I
Several stories high


Knowing I'm on the street where you live


Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?




And oh! The towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear
People stop and star
They don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth
That I would rather be
Let the time go by
I won't care if I

1275,"When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?"
1276,"Oo, you say you're feeling bad cause
The least thing makes you cry
Sounds like a real bad case
Of a girl who needs a guy
I think I know the perfect jewel
One you ought to try
Take a heart that's full of love
On this you can rely


If you need some quick reaction, take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction, take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely, take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine


I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
Goodbye to all those different drugs and hard-swallowed pills
My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled




Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just leave you at the most
The relief is only temporary
Pretty soon will go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to
There is no overdose"
1277,"Unforgettable, that's what you are
Yes, unforgettable, though near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more


Unforgettable in every way
Yes, and forever more, that's how you'll stay
And that's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too


Oh, like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay

 Oo here I am alone, thinking aimlessly
Seeing other girls in love & wishing it were me
If I could only find the key & make love come my way
I would trade this loneliness for true love any day



 When love comes knocking at my heart
I'm surely going to let it in
When love comes knocking at my heart
Happiness will surely begin



 Oh darling, 
 Oh darling

 Oh darling, 
 Oh darling



 Emptiness is in the air & all around me gloom
As I gaze through the window of my lonely room
I hate to get up in the morning 'cause I know what lies ahead
Where there should be a cheerful smile, there's loneliness instead





 Oh if you've never been in love, darling
Then you're just like me, now

 Don't you get lonely? What am I to be?





 My heart's full of envy for the girl who lives next door
She has so many things that I've never had before

 She possesses one thing I've never had a chance to get
That's someone to call her own & there's one thing you can bet







 When love comes, I'm going to let it in
Because I know I'll be happy then
Loneliness will be no more
When love comes, gonna open that door
When love comes, when love comes
Oh darling, when love comes"

Like the house you built from toothpicks stacked upon the kitchen table
One last toothpick tore it down; the foundation was not able




Oh baby, one more heartache would be too much load
I'm fed up with the heartaches; one more and I will explode
Like the toy balloon that's filled with as much air as it can take
One more puff of air and that balloon has got to burst

When every night and day
I had to live the life of a lonely one
And I remember meeting you
Discovering love could be so true
When shared by two, instead of only one


When you said you loved me
We could not be parted
Said, I built my world around you
And I'm truly glad I found you


Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
I never felt so good before
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
Yes it has, you know it has


Each night I pray we'll never part
Because the love within my heart
Grows stronger from day to day
Best I try, hard I try
To reassure and satisfy
You know I'd be lost if you went away




Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
I never felt so good before
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
Yes it has, you know it has
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
Don't you know my baby there
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever"

 Oh baby, there's a letter on the floor
That I just can't read no more
Cause the words upon its face are saying goodbye
There's a plate upon the table
Filled with food I could not eat
There's a made-up bed in the bedroom where I couldn't sleep
I just sit & weep


Oh baby, that's how it is since you've been gone
That's how it is, I'm so all alone



 Now the curtains are drawn in my lonely room
& the darkness fills the air
& this old empty heart of mine is in despair
Even though the tears I shed
Washed the words away
I could still remember every word you had to say
They just wouldn't go away





 Oh baby, you knew right from the start
That my heart was in your hands

 & your every, every wish, boy, was my command
That's why I can't understand
How you could leave me here helpless, dear
Alone & afraid, oh how could such a mistake be made?

Stop, look, yes, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying

Though you try, you can't hide
All the things you really feel, this time decide

 All it takes is 2 hearts that care

 Sprinkle just a little tenderness there

 And like the tiny grains of sand that build a mountain so high

 Each tender moment builds love between a girl & guy



 It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love



 Take a boy like you & a girl like me

 2 lonely people we used to be

 We shared a little time, tears & laughter

 It seems that we will be happy ever after

 All it takes is 2 arms that know

 They got to hold you, baby, & never let go

 Throw in a lover's quarrel & it's sealed with a kiss

 We know that heaven must be like this





 I used to wander, I used to roam

 Like a ship in a storming sea, trying to get home

 When we found each other, heaven found a way

 'Cause you were the dawn of a bright sunny day

 All it takes is just a little time

 3 little words, baby, that mean ""Will you will be mine?""

 Add a few tears 2 lovers will shed

 And every sweet word that's ever been said





 Take a girl like me & a boy like you

 Long lonely hours we once knew

 We have each other & live what life's worth

 All love is strong enough to move heaven & earth



 It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love"

If my heart could sing
I'd sing a song that all the world could feel
One that each word a thought would bring


If my heart could sing, sing


I'd sing of love to tell my story
Of how love brought me you
And like a bell, I'd toll and ring


If my heart could sing, sing


There are things I'd like to tell you
Things I'd felt along the way
But my lips can't speak the magic words
That my heart alone can say
Oh, I'd prove to you I'll always love you
Girl, I will, until the end of time
I'll make each day eternal spring

Nothing but plans
That's how it's going to be
This is the life for me
This is the life
Here's where the living is
This is the life
Baby, you're there
This is the life
You've waited long enough
Boy, you've arrived
Breathe in that air
Modern perfume
Silver and candlelight
Children, make way
I'm here to stay
Nothing but plans
That's how it's going to be
This is the life for me"
1340,"Symphony
She's only known as symphony
Melody, yeah
Crept- crept into the soul of me
Symphony, yeah
She's sort of like a song, she moves along
In perfect rhyme, oh la la
Right now feel perfect time, baby
You and me to slip away, slip away
Let our song begin to play
Yeah baby


Make me the one darling
Only one who know the bliss
Of knowing when to kiss
All the love of symphony, symphony


Like violins, music begins
It starts to swell, then I can tell
That pretty soon we going to be in tune
Our hearts will be in perfect harmony


Symphony
Got my heart hit like a tender beat, ""boom Boom""
When you want me, send for me, ""cha cha""
And I'll come and love you tenderly
Hey oh, I'll do the things girl
Oh making you feel that my love is for real for You
Symphony, symphony, oh
Do the thing makes you feel that I love you darling"
1341,"One, two, one!
Two, three!"
1342,"Whoa, ah, mercy, mercy me
Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east
Whoa, mercy, mercy me
Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Oil wasted on the oceans and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury
Ah, ah, oh, mercy, mercy me
Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Radiation underground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby by are dying
Oh, mercy, mercy me
Ah, things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land?
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
Ooh, oh, na, na, na na na
Na na na na na, my my, my sweet Lord"
1343,"Ooh, the girl I love walked out on me
Leaving her love flowing strong
Oh, my heart would like to carry on
But she said her feeling for me was gone
I tried to find the words to say to make her stay


But she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change what you can
But when you can't leave it alone
Have the sense to know the difference between the two


I know the girl is on her way
Taking the love I need so bad
Oh, the love I guessed I'd never have
So what's the use of sitting around and feeling sad
I must respect the fact she won't be back my way


Cause she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change what you can
But when you can't leave it alone
Have the sense to know the difference between the two


I sit around in misery
Over a love that don't belong to me
I did everything I could to make her stay


But she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change it, baby
Oh, change if you want to
You got to change, alright
Oh, change it, honey
Honey, you can change it"
1344,"Pretend you're happy when you're blue
It isn't very hard to do
And you'll find happiness without an end
Whenever you pretend
Remember, anyone can dream
And nothing's as bad as it may seem
The little things you haven't got could be a lot if you pretend
You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes, she'll be there
You'll never be alone
And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?


You'll find a love you can share
One you can call all your own
Just close your eyes, she'll be there
You'll never be alone
And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend?"
1345,"You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight


Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?


Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded


These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, alive


Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Under the bright but faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?


Where are you now?
Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now? Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded"
1346,"We're not in love
We share no stories
Just something in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind


Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side
Fall into the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side


Beneath the sky
As black as diamonds
We're running out of time 

Don't wait for truth
To come and blind us
Let's just believe their lies


Believe it, I see it
I know that you can feel it
No secrets worth keeping
So fool me like I'm dreaming


Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side
Fall into the dark side
Give into the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side


Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it, let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side"
1347,"Hello, sweet grief
I know you'll be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again


I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel


If I had a diamond heart, oh, oh
I'd give you all my love if I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh, oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable


I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got


I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered
Into the poison, cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got
If


Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
'Cause every station's playing our song
Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made up
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable


I wish that I did not know 

Where all broken lovers go 

I wish that my heart was made of stone


Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel


If I had a diamond heart, oh oh
I'd give you all my love if I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable


I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got


I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered
Into the poison, cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got


La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
This is the story
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I'd give you all my love 

If I was unbreakable
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You could shoot me with a gun of gold 

If I was unbreakable
I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bendin' like a tulip, blue-eyed and foolish

Give you all I got 

I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered
Into the poison, cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got"
1348,"What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do
And I run right back to you
You crossed the line and it's time to say ""F you""
What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that


'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
[Verse 2: Juliander & 
 Noah Cyrus
]
Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I try 
staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope
, but I still 
can't let you go


'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine


I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine-ine-ine 

I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine-ine-ine 

I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine-ine-ine 

I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine

'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever (
Then whatever, babe

When it don't work out for the better (
For the better

If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down (
When it all, when it all
)
When it all falls down (
When it all falls down

I'll be fine (
Fine, fine, fine

I'll be fine (
I'll be fine

You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine (
I'll be fine

1349,"We were young, posters on the wall
Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
We would stare at each other
'Cause we were always in trouble
And all the cool kids did their own thing
I was on the outside always looking in
Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
They never really cared if I wasn't


We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows


I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone


Then I saw your face, your forgiving eyes
Looking back at me from the other side
Like you understood me
And I'm never letting you go, oh


We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows


I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone

I'm not gonna make it alone"
1350,"I'm sorry but, don't wanna talk
I need a moment before I go, it's nothing personal
I draw the blinds, they don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand, they don't understand


So then, when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business and ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery, make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favorite girl


So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way


Blep, yah, yah

Yah-yah-yah-yah


Lo siento mucho 
, pero me voy 

Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy 

Y me cansé de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errores, también soy humano
Y tú no vez que lo hago porque te amo 



Pero ya 
, no tengo más na' que hacer aquí 

Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir 

De mi propio camino, seguiré lejos de ti


So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise 

The fire burning in my eyes 

No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way

I'm on my way


Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe
Everybody, everybody keep me safe

1351,"Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me go

f this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone


I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone


Unconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away


If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone


I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone


I'm not alone, I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

I know I'm not alone"
1352,"I see those tears in your eyes
I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired


Cold hands, red eyes
Packed two bags at midnight
They've been there for weeks
You don't know what goodbye means
Just roll up a cigarette
Just forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines


I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired


When you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don’t talk
And if they could, they’d say
Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines


I see those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
Oh love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
I know those tears in your eyes
And I feel so helpless inside
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired"
1353,"Wait a second, let me catch my breath
Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing
Livin' life as if we had a choice
Anywhere, anytime
I would do anything for you
Anything for you
Yesterday got away
Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breath


Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep




Remember me now, time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby


Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Oh, won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep




A-anytime
I would do do do do
Time away
Yesterday-day
A-anytime
I would do do do do
Time away
Yesterday-day-ay-ay-ay"
1354,"We used to hide under the covers
Serenade each other
With careless melodies
Something buried deep inside us
The major and the minor
We're like piano keys


You played for me
You played for me, Oh-oh
You played for me
I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be


You played for me
You played for me
You played for me


We couldn't stop the world from turning
It was like a whirlwind
Scattered us like leaves
But I'm stuck inside a feeling
The song that never leaves
We were like a symphony


You played for me
You played for me, Oh-oh
You played for me
I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be


You played for me
You played for me
You played for me


You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
You played for me


I swear it, even in my sleep
I hear it like the memory
Of everything we used to be
You played for me"
1355,"Hello, hello, can you hear me as I scream your name?
Hello, hello, do you need me before I fade away?


Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie 



Hello, hello, nice to meet you, voice inside my head
Hello, hello, I believe you, how can I forget?


Is this the place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie
Deep in the dark, I don't need the light

We live, we love, we lie"
1356,"Ummm, yea
Mirrors they never lie
Don't see myself inside
Why can’t I get it right?
I don’t know
You're always watching me fall
Shadows they like my wall
Why do I feel so small?
I don't know


So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know


I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
Ooh


Tired of being afraid
But lately, I've lost my faith
What is love without pain, it ain't home
You're watching me but I'm below
When I get caught I hope
This is kinda like how they will
Take me home


So I walk into the dead of night
Where my monsters like to hide
Chaos feels so good inside
Now I know


I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again


I know that I'm a mess
But I ain't trying to be the best
Oh, whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay
Never said I was an angel
I am damaged all the way
So whatever's coming next
I better pray-ay-ay-ay


I've lost, I've lost
I've lost control again
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again
I don't, I don't
I don't know who I am
Always do the same and not to blame I've lost control again"
1357,"All we know
Left untold
Beaten by a broken dream
Nothing like what it used to be 



We've been chasing our demons down an empty road
Been watching our castle turning into dust
Escaping our shadows just to end up here
Once more
And we both know


This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time


Broken smile, tired eyes
I can feel your longing heart
Call my name, howling from afar


We've been fighting our demons just to stay afloat
Been building a castle just to watch it fall
Been running forever just to end up here
Once more
And now we know


This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time


Take me back
Back to the mountainside
Under the Northern Lights
Chasing the stars
Take me back
Back to the mountainside
When we were full of life
Back to the start
And we both know that


This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
We are stuck on answers we can't find
But we  got time
And even though we might have lost tonight
The skyline reminds us of a different time
This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time"
1358,"In the dark of night
The stars light up the sky
We see them flying free
That's just like you and me


Everyone is lonely sometimes 

But I would walk a thousand miles to see your eyes
You are not alone, we are family 

Hold me, let's escape all this reality


You are my symphony
By your side, we are unity
You are my energy
My guiding light, we are unity

 We are unity

 We are unity


Although the rain might pour
A thunder starts to roar
The lightnin' wakes the wave
But through it, we are brave


Everyone is lonely sometimes 

But I would walk a thousand miles to see your eyes
You are not alone, we are family 

Hold me, let's escape all this reality


You are my symphony
By your side, we are unity 

You are my energy
My guiding light, we are unity

 We are unity

 We are unity
We are unity


You are my symphony 

By your side 

You are my energy

1359,"Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then she tried to run
And then on the night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone


They warned her, don’t go there
There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping
It told her, don’t you worry just


Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh


She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke, and she awoke again


Then she ran faster and
Start screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me
Come get me
Behind her, she can hear it say


Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you’ve been told 

And you’ll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh


Follow everywhere I go
Top over the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you’ve been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Then she ran faster and
Start screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me
Just let me in, ooh"

Today, I'm kinda feelin' like a ghost 

Call my friends, but ain't nobody home 

Tell myself I'm fine, but I don't really know 

I'm just scared that I'll end up, I'll end up, I'll end up alone
I never let it show 

But I feel like a missed call on a phone 

Tryna live my life, pay-as-you-go
But I'm so scared that I'll end up, I'll end up, I'll end up alone


You know I'm like a ghost, sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost, I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost


You know I never meant to cut you off
Got phantom feelings I can never solve
Stranger things to worry 'bout, I know
But I'm so scared that I'll end up, I'll end up, I'll end up alone
I can't see myself in the mirror
Does that mean I'm not really here?
I'm losin' touch with everything I know
And I'm so scared that I'll end up, I'll end up, I'll end up alone

And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost, I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold, I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost






You know I'm like a ghost




Ooh, I'll be okay, I'll be alright, I know
Ooh, I'll be okay, I'm just scared that I'll end up alone




You know I'm like a ghost, I see it in your face

Karate chop the shit in half till they find my match 

Till they find me laying dead on my back

Putting up a fight until I collapse

So carelessly
Then the rain came and yours was gone
And now mine it stands alone

I'll do this on my own
We knew it all then now this is all I know
Guess I'm heading home now
Guess I'm heading home now
Guess I'm heading home now

With the sound of our lives and the sweetest escape
And the neighbors would complain
We would turn it up louder, who cares anyway?


'Cause we, we remembered that we were young
Our lives, were grains in the sand
That we, made our castles and kingdoms of
Now the waves have torn them down


Nobody sees me, now I'm a one man show

I’ll be here
I can't see
I can’t breathe, anymore

Drunk on the pain

Just let me love you when your heart is tired

Of a lie I wish you never told

The words we chose, irrelevant
Let's just pretend a little bit

Would you do it if I asked you to stay
Or would you tell me it's a little too late?
'Cause if it is I'd be happy to fade
Said I'd pick a better time and a place, yeah
But if it's not and you still got monsters
My demons would be happy to play
Just look at everyone's faces, you know that they faded
Always escaping, I did too much taking
Now when you say shit, it feels it's nothin' like
When I had you, girl, at least I had somethin' right
Deep like the ocean, seizing the moment
My cards are showing


Where are you now? Atlantis

But if you ever wanna do it to me again
I probably would let ya

To say that I'm messed up's an understatement
It's time that I let go, I'm done with hatin'
I hear music having me blasting
Life is steadily passing, baby, I'm not exaggeratin'
So I'ma keep deep diving
Just to see you, where you hidin'?
And if you aren't in the sea
I just wait until I dream just to see if I can find you

That's OK that's alright
Go ahead and live your life
That's OK that's alright
But don't blame me if I get sad sometimes


I still got a messed up point of view
All I see in everything is you oh
Did you always keep me in the dark

Vámono' a meternos pa'l agua pa' que veas qué rico se siente
Y vámono' en tropical, por to’a la costa a chinchorrear 

De chinchorro a chinchorro paramo’ a darno' una Medalla

1374,"Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then she tried to run
And then on the night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone
They warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are
Hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping
It told her
Don't you worry, just


Follow everywhere I go
Top over the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you wantin' gonna be the
Magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh


She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke, and she awoke again
Then she ran faster than
Start screaming, ""Is there someone out there?""
Please help me, come get me
Behind her, she can hear it say


Follow everywhere I go
Top over the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you wantin' gonna be the
Magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control

Remind me how it feels to hear your voice
Your lips are movin', I can't hear a thing

Yesterday got away
Melodies stuck inside your head
A song in every breath


Sing me to sleep now
Sing me to sleep
Won't you sing me to sleep now?
Sing me to sleep


A song in every breath


Remember me now, time cannot erase
I can hear your whispers in my mind
I've become what you cannot embrace
Our memory will be my lullaby

And now mine it stays alone


Nobody sees me, now I'm a one man show
I'll do this on my own
We knew it all, then  now this is all I know
Guess I'm heading home now




Guess I'm heading home now


When the music always played
With the sound of our lives and the sweetest escape
And the neighbors would complain
We would turn it up louder, who cares anyway?


'Cause we, we remember that we were young
Our lives, were grains in the sand
And made up castles and kingdoms of
Now the rains have torn them down




Nobody sees me, now I'm a one man show
I'll do this on my own

Guess I'm heading home now"

I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been

All it takes is that one look you do and I run right back to you
You cross the line and it's time to say ""F"" you
What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck, with you, and that's that


'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
When it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine 



Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I tried staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope, but I still can't let you go


'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
When it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine

To make sure I never love again


I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone 

Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel


If I had a diamond heart, oh, oh
I'd give you all my love if I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh, oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable




Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
'Cause every station's playing our song
Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made up
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable


I wish that I did not know 

Where all broken lovers go 

I wish that my heart was made of stone


Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel


If I had a diamond heart, oh oh
I'd give you all my love if I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable
I...

Then the rain came and yours was gone
And now mine, it stands alone

With the sound of our lives
And the sweetest escape
And the neighbors would complain
We would turn it up louder
Who cares anyway?

We remember that we were young
Our lives were grains in the sand
That we made our castles and kingdoms of
Now the waves have torn them down

There's creatures who are hiding in the dark

It's nothing personal
I draw the blinds
They don't need to see me cry 

But I'll be fine  



Get out 'fore I die


Burning like a candle both ends dripping spills loose
Ends burn heads burning end bridges
Better use the stairs till your legs hurting
Running for the hills
I'm on their heels keep their heads turning
Consider it a fair warning
My partners steady moving like it's feds on us




Are you lonely?
Are you lonely?
Are you lonely?
I'll stand by you


It turns me on again
You and I

Apart, but still, together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone




You could shoot me with a gun of stone
If I was unbreakable
Just let me love you when your heart is tired
Hello, Hello
Can you hear me?
As I scream your name


Although the rain might pour
A thunder starts to roar
The lightnin' wakes the wave
But through it, we are brave


This is not the world we had in mind
But we got time
And we are stuck on answers we can't find
But we got time
If your ghost pulls you apart
And it feels like you've lost who you are
My love, there's no need to hide
Just let me love you when your heart is tired


You're my symphony by your side
You're my energy, My guiding light 

I'll take it up, an elevation
I'll stand on the highest peak
You'll never doubt my dedication
I'm here till eternity


Wait a second, let me catch my breath
When it don't work out for the better
Never said I was an angel
I was damaged all the way
So whatever's coming next, I better pray 

More minutes and I'll go 



The lightning makes the wave 

I don't know who I am 

Always do the same and not to blame
I lost control again 

I'm faded




Just let me in 

And I'm on my way 

I'll stand by you
If I had a Dimond Heart
I'll stand by you
We live, We love, We lie

And it feels like you’ve lost who you are

Just let me love you when your heart is tired




When you whisper, I'm alright
But I see through your white lies
But these walls don't talk
And if they could, they'd say


Can't hide the secrets
You can't forget about this mess
I'm waiting on the sidelines
From the sidelines


I see those tears in your eyes

Through your winter window
It won't be my face you see
When December winds blow
I've got to keep moving on
Won't let the grass grow
I've never stayed around too long
Just a face in a fading photo
It won't be my voice you hear
In your sleeping hedgerow
Just a note in the call
Of the lonely laughing black crow
I asked you when this all began
With summer's first swallow
Did you really need a man
Who just lives for tomorrow
My steps are quiet memories
On your frosted meadow
Made by a ghost set free
That never casts a shadow
Please don't sit & cry
This love has caused you sorrow
All that's in this world must die
Like melted summer snow
In the spring's warming light
A quiet whispered ""Hello""
Like a fingers dancing flight
On the strings of a cello
Before the winter comes again
And the leaves leave the willow
You won't remember me
Forgotten song on the radio"

You can draw the blinds

Bound to your bed

Feel my scattered heart

Underneath the river
If you stay, if you stay
We could sleep here
Underneath the river
If you stay, if you stay
We could go home
We could go home
Down below, low, low
Nobody knows where we will go
Down below, low, low
Can we stay inside?
Lay here by the fire
Please dont let me go
Say it ain't so
Leave me in the night
With no warning sign
Are we burning out?
Mirrors and smoke?
We could lay here
Underneath the river
If you stay, if you stay
We could sleep here
Underneath the river
If you stay, if you stay

Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite


One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite


So alive, your touch is like the daylight
Burning on my skin, it turns me on again
You and I, survivors of the same kind
And we're the only ones
Dancing on the sun


Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite


One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite


Diamonds are forever, but all we need is just tonight
We're monumental tremors that can freeze the speed of life
Just like particles that's falling from heaven all over the stars
Hear you calling for me
Hear you calling me on from afar


Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
I feel the heat as we collide
Like a fever that feels so right
So baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite


One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite"
1464,"December snow is cold on my skin
There's a hole where the truth's been blowing in
Another empty sky awakening
And that old homesick feeling once again
The midday sun from a thousand sacred hours
Has bleached all the colour from the flowers
You painted on the sign by our door
But we don't walk those rooms anymore
Now I'm sitting here
And I'm trying to explain
Why all that I have
Is this hatful of rain
A mile of golden chains cannot bind us
And if I could, I'd throw away the key
Everything but the past is behind us
This is not how it was meant to be
I remember how I found you
Broken glass all around you
And the crimson spreading stain
And how I cried out your name
So take me back where the air tastes sweet
And I can feel God's earth beneath my feet
Where I can sit in my easy chair
And make believe I can see you walking there
I can feel you near
But nothing is the same
Wish I could see your face
In this hatful of rain"
1465,"I'm leaving here tomorrow I'm freeing you
Please don't try to follow I guess it's true
That being lost
Is worth the cost
Of the love that we knew
The love that we knew
This world is full of strangers I'm close to you
A sea of broken faces and a thought that flew
A thousand miles
Through endless aisles
Of colours flooding through
Colours flooding through
The fading light I don't want to fight lets hold it to the sun
Hold it to the sun
You're the only one
Your cotton dress one soft caress your eyes of ocean blue
Eyes of ocean blue
I still love you
I'm holding on
Still holding on
A voice inside is calling and I want something new
Don't be sad and crying this is long overdue
The empty days
Just tick away
Could you save me a few
Please save a few
I'm sitting in this cafe on a warm summer's day
Watching people talking but I've nothing to say
They can't see
How it feels to be
Just drifting away
The fading light I don't want to fight lets hold it to the sun
Hold it to the sun
You're the only one
Your cotton dress one soft caress your eyes of ocean blue
Eyes of ocean blue
I still love you
I'm holding on
Still holding on"
1466,"The waves on the shore
Have got my mind wandering
To a time we shared
Long before
The sun on your face
And your hand on the violin
Close my eyes and listen
To the rain
Walked out today to the gulls call
Swear I saw you by the sea
Reached out to you in freefall
Woke up drowning in memories
There's a shadow on the water
It's getting too dark for me to see
Only the echo
Of her laughter
Takes me to the place
Where I want to be
On the tide today
Washed up on the sand
Fading flowers from a wreath
Or a bouquet
Walked out to the south
Stood in the salt spray
I could taste your last tears
In my mouth
There's a ship that sails
To places I've never seen
I could board her and ride
On the trades
You know that I
Will never leave here
But my mark will fade away
Bye & bye
Walked out today to the gulls call
Swear I saw you by the sea
Reached out to you in freefall
Woke up drowning in memories
There's a shadow on the water
It's getting too dark for me to see
Only the echo
Of her laughter
Can take me to the place
Where I want to be"
1467,"There's blue sky above me and soft southern rain
Storm clouds are clearing I'm smiling again
What is the reason for this new happiness
I've married the girl in the green summer dress


White sheets of morning and a step on the stair
I open my eyes and she's standing there
There's no one in this world I need to impress
'Cause I married the girl in the green summer dress


I can see her
Running down the roads of my memory
Blowing through the years
That she gave to me
Wearing that dress
So gracefully


I saw her out walking on the first day of spring
Picked her a flower she didn't say anything
I made up my mind then and I think you can guess
To marry that girl in the green summer dress


There's a glow of promise before the sunrise
There's a lifetime of wisdom in an old man's eyes
If there's meaning to this it's in the caress
Of the girl I married in the green summer dress


I can see her
Running down the roads of my memory
Blowing through the years
That she gave to me
Wearing that dress
So gracefully


Are we here for a purpose, it's too soon to tell
Has it all been for nothing a final farewell
I'll keep just one day; they can take all the rest
The day I married the girl in the green summer dress
The day I married the girl in the green summer dress"
